One of Hong Kong's last surviving wartime heroes who spent the
four years of Japanese occupation in a prisoner of war camp, has
died aged 90, the Royal British Legion here confirmed Wednesday.


Arthur Gomes, who despite being born in the former British colony
was a Portuguese national, was declared dead in hospital Monday,
where he had been admitted with a chest infection, a Legion
spokeswoman said.


In 1954 Gomes formed the Hong Kong Prisoners of War Association,
fighting for special recognition of POWs and their families and
in 1954 was awarded the MBE by Britain's Queen Elizabeth for his
efforts.


Gomes was a lance corporal with the Hong Kong Volunteers Defence
Force when British troops surrendered to the Japanese onslaught
on Christmas Day, 1941.


While imprisoned, he was regularly tortured and forced to help
construct the runway at what would become Hong Kong's Kai Tak
Airport.
