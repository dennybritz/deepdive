New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming admitted his side had been
completely outclassed by Sri Lanka after the Asian side cruised
into the World Cup final on Tuesday.


Sri Lanka, riding on the back of an unbeaten 115 by skipper
Mahela Jayawardene, wrapped up an 81-run win and will now face
either Australia or South Africa in Saturday's final in Barbados.


"We were outclassed," said Fleming after his side were bowled out
for 208 chasing 290 to win at Sabina Park.


"They have some big game players and a lot of heavy artillery in
their bowling line-up.


"We had hoped to restrict them to the mid-200s but Mahela played
a great innings and we conceded 100 runs in the last 10 overs -
that was very poor.


"The margin of victory was about right."


Jayawardene had won the toss and elected to bat and Sri Lanka
made the most of a wayward display by spearhead Shane Bond who
finished with 1-59 off his 10 overs.


In stark contrast, Sri Lanka's opening pair Chaminda Vaas and
Lasith Malinga bowled two impressive, mean opening spells as New
Zealand were limited to 30-1 off the first 10 overs.


"Even if we won the toss I don't think it would have changed the
result," said Fleming who had a miserable time with the bat being
lbw to Malinga for just one in the second over.


"Vaas and Malinga bowled great opening spells and that's where
the match was won and lost. Then Murali (4-31) came on. We gave
him an opening and it's rare that he doesn't take it."
