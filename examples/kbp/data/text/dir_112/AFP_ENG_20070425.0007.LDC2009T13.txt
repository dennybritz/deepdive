North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il Wednesday attended a big military
parade in Pyongyang marking the anniversary of the country's
army, state media reported.


Kim waved to the crowd for several minutes during the 90-minute
ceremony on a square in the capital, according to North Korean
broadcasts monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency.


Missile units were among those taking part in the parade, Yonhap
said, adding that the square was decorated with a sea of flowers.


The event marked the 75th anniversary of the Korean People's
Army.


The communist state says its army was founded by late president
Kim Il-Sung during his independence battle against Japan, which
colonised the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945.
