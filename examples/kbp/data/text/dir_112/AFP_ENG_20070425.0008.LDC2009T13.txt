Chinese share prices slipped in Wednesday morning trade on
profit-taking with power generators and metal stocks losing
ground, dealers said.


They said subscriptions to the Bank of Communication, following
the CITIC bank, has slowed down the new money influx into the
market and corrections will continue for before the May holiday
beginning next week.


"The market saw a correction on profit-taking ahead of the one-
week long May 1 holidays, and the consolidation is likely to
continue over the coming days," Shen Jun, an analyst at
Shangzhenglian Consulting, said.


"The start of subscriptions to the Bank of Communications'
A-share initial public offering today also diverted some of the
market liquidity," Shen added.


Hong Kong-listed Bank of Communications scheduled the retail
subscription to its initial public offering in Shanghai on April
25, and the sale to institutional investors on April 24-25.


CITIC bank, scheduled to debut on Friday, priced 2.3 billion A
shares to be listed in Shanghai at 5.80 yuan (80 US cents) each.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning down
27.44 points or 0.74 percent at 3,693.09, after touching an
intraday all-time high of 3,769.25.


The Shanghai A-share Index was down 28.98 points or 0.74 percent
at 3,881.41 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was down 22.52 points
or 2.05 percent at 1,075.0.
