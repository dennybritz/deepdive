Bolivian police searched the La Paz house of former president
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada on Tuesday as they probed his role in
the deaths 63 people during a 2003 demonstration.


Authorities said they sought documents that may provide details
of the then- government's handling of the violent 2003 crisis
that eventually led Sanchez de Lozada's resigning and leaving the
country for the United States.


During the five-hour search in the posh house surrounded by
gardens, authorities found "several documents that will have to
be analyzed," including videotapes and papers, said the case's
lead prosecutor, Milton Mendoza.


Prosecutors want to try Sanchez de Lozada under genocide charges
for his role in the violence, in which 63 people were killed and
432 wounded as police and military troops clashed with strikers
protesting plans to export natural gas to the United States
through Chile.


Relations between La Paz and Santiago have been strained ever
since Bolivia was left landlocked by Chile's annexation of
disputed territory more than 100 years ago.


Sanchez de Lozada resigned in October 2003, barely 14 months into
his second five-year term, and now lives in the United States.
