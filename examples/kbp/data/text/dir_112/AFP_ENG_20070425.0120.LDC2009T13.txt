Pornographic material accounts for nearly 70 percent of messages
exchanged through mobile telephones between teenagers in ultra-
conservative Muslim Saudi Arabia, a newspaper reported Wednesday.


Misuse of Bluetooth technology by young men and women is
increasing, the English-language Arab News said, citing the
findings of a recent study.


Eighty-eight percent of girls have been "victims" of such misuse,
it quoted study author and professor Abdullah bin Mohammad al-
Rasheed as saying.


The study focused on teenage boys detained by religious police
for harassing girls in the Qasim region north of Riyadh.


"The flash memory of mobile phones taken from teenagers showed
69.7 percent of 1,470 files saved in them were pornographic and
8.6 percent were related to violence," Rasheed said.


Young men and women are banned from mixing in public in oil-rich
Saudi Arabia, which enforces a strict Islamic moral code.


Bluetooth technology links devices such as mobile phones
wirelessly.


In a separate study of 1,200 women aged 18 to 25, Rasheed found
that 82 percent of them use Bluetooth continuously, Arab News
said.


The paper said 99 percent believe the device has broken the
barrier of social taboo and traditions, and about 77 percent
admitted they had used it even inside the grand mosque in Mecca,
Islam's holiest shrine.
