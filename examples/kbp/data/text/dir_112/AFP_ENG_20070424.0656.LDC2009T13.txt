Mexico City lawmakers voted Tuesday to legalize abortion and make
the Mexican capital only the second place in Latin America after
Cuba where women can terminate early pregnancies without
restrictions.


The vote, after seven hours of debate, was 46 in favor, 19
against and one abstention in the city legislature, which is
dominated by the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution.
