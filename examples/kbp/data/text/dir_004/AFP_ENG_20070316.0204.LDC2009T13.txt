Thai environmental authorities said Friday the sinking of a sugar
cargo ship on the country's main river probably caused the deaths
of up to one million fish earlier in the week.


Hundreds of thousands of farmed fish and natural fish died in the
central provinces of Ang Thong and Ayutthaya after oxygen levels
in the Chao Phraya river fell dramatically, authorities said.


"The capsizing (of) the sugar vessel coincided with the low
oxygen level in the water. Sugar absorbs oxygen as it dissolves
in water, which could explain the problem," Paisal Kulvalairat,
an environment ministry inspector told a news conference.


The ship carrying 650 tonnes of brown sugar sank on March 3, but
the fish began dying eight days later, he said.


Most of the fish were caged tubtim, a type of tilapia, being
raised at different locations along the river about 100
kilometres (60 miles) north of Bangkok.


Local residents have blamed industrial runoff from a local
factory for the fish deaths, and Paisal said that possibility was
still under investigation.


"We are not ignoring the possibility that industrial plants had
released untreated water, so we set up a special committee with
public health and pollution control officials, as well as our
ministry, to investigate," he said.


Paisal said the water quality would improve over the next four to
five days and should be back to normal within 10 days, after a
dam upstream began releasing clean water.


Ang Thong's provincial governor Benjawan Artplueng said 75 fish
farmers have reported combined losses of 49 million baht (1.4
million dollars) and have filed complaints with police.
