Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn, Japan's breakthrough foreign
manager, said Friday he will juggle roles to take charge of
finances at the automaker which he has said is in a "performance
crisis."


Ghosn, who balances his time with leading France's Renault, will
give up the helm of the Japanese company's management committee
for the Americas.


But he will also take over supervision of the company's treasury
department from Toshiyuki Shiga, Nissan's number-two.


Shiga will also quit as top of a management committee for general
overseas markets.


"The priority for our new management team is to act decisively on
the multiple challenges facing Nissan and to boost our overall
performance in 2007," Ghosn said in a statement.


The globetrotting Ghosn, a Brazilian-born Frenchman of Lebanese
origin, took charge of Nissan in 1999 and turned the automaker
around from near bankruptcy to robust profits.


But Nissan expects its net profits to slip in the current fiscal
year for the first time since Ghosn took over, in what its one-
time saviour has described as a "performance crisis."
