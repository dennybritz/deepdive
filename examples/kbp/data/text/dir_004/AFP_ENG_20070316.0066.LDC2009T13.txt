A civilian was killed and two wounded as insurgents fired mortars
at a Sunni mosque in Baghdad on Friday, a security official said.


Insurgents fired three rounds at the Al-Khilani mosque in the
southern district of Zafaraniyah, he said.


The projectiles struck near the mosque, killing one person and
wounding two more, he added.


Every Friday, authorities impose a vehicle ban in the Iraqi
capital between 11:00 am (0800 GMT) and 3:00 pm (1200 GMT) to
thwart any insurgent attacks on worshippers attending weekly
prayers.


Baghdad is engulfed in a vicious Sunni-Shiite sectarian conflict
following which around 90,000 US and Iraqi troops have been
deployed in the city as part of a major crackdown to curb the
violence.
