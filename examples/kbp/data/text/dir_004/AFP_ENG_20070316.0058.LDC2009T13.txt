A Russian court has ordered Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime
minister and now a prominent opposition figure, to return a
luxury country home he bought from the state, domestic media
reported on Friday.


"The court ordered the return of the state dacha to state
property," the Interfax news agency quoted a court spokeswoman as
saying.


The decision comes after another court ruled on February 2 that
Kasyanov's acquisition of the country home -- known as a "dacha"
in Russia -- was illegal.


Kasyanov served as prime minister during President Vladimir
Putin's first term before he was replaced in 2004. Critics say he
bought the dacha at a fraction of its real market value shortly
before he left office.


Kasyanov, who has become a vocal critic of Putin and has
announced plans to stand in Russia's presidential elections next
year, has called the court challenges to his ownership of the
property "political" and "unfounded".
