Twenty-nine cats and a dog died in an apartment fire in the
western Paris suburb of Plaisir, police said on Friday.


Only one cat managed to escape on Wednesday from the burning
third-floor apartment, which belonged to a woman known to keep
many of the pets in cages.


Neighbours quoted by Le Parisien newspaper said the unnamed woman
was facing eviction and set fire to the apartment, saying she
wanted to die with her animals. She was rescued by the fire-
service.


This version was not confirmed by police.
