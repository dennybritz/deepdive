Malaysian share prices are expected to be choppy next week as
anxiety remains over the uncertainties in the outlook of the
regional markets, analysts said Friday.


"With risk appetite under pressure due to the sharp swings in
prices, the market has turned uncertain with huge jumps and
declines intra-day," said Danny Oh, a senior analyst from Mercury
Securities.


Oh said recent "mood swings" and volatility signified "massive
uncertainties and anxiety" in the market.


"Hence trading is expected to be choppy and traders are advised
to stay cautious as the market has yet to settle down," Oh said.


He said although concern over the US economy had dissipated, the
undertone of the Malaysian bourse remained cautious.


Oh said volatile price movements may present some intra-day
trading opportunities.


For the week ending March 16, the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange
composite index lost 6.63 points or 0.55 percent to 1,182.20.


Average daily volume for the week slowed further to 1.3 billion
shares worth 1.8 billion ringgit (513.96 million dollars), down
from 2.3 billion shares worth 2.75 billion ringgit last week.
