The Northern Hemisphere had its warmest winter since records
began 128 years ago, a US government agency said in a report
which added fuel to international concerns over global warming.


A record warm January worldwide pushed average temperatures in
December-February to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit (0.72 degrees
Celsius) above normal for the 20th century, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration said (NOAA).


It was the highest average temperature since records began in
1880, the NOAA said in a report released Thursday.


The El Nino phenomenon, the abnormal warming of surface ocean
waters in the eastern Pacific, contributed to the unseasonably
warm Northern Hemisphere winter, the agency said.


The ocean-surface temperature in the period tied for second
warmest on record, just 0.1 degree Fahrenheit (0.06 degrees
Celsius) cooler than the record established during the very
strong El Nino episode of 1997-1998.


A United Nations study last month said human activity was almost
certain to blame for global warming and warned that the Earth's
average surface temperature could rise between 1.1 and 6.4
degrees by 2100.
