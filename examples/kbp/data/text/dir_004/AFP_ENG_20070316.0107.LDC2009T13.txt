The British government is to sign in the next few days a contract
for refuelling aircraft worth 18.5 billion euros (24.6 billion
dollars), the French newspaper La Tribune reported on Friday.


The British defence ministry is to finalise the deal, which
includes aircraft and servicing for 27 years, before asking for
final approval from the finance ministry.


The order will be placed in the next month with the AirTanker
consortium, which includes European aerospace group EADS, French
group Thales and British companies Rolls Royce, Cobham, and VT
Group.


The contract is to include an order for about 15 Airbus A330-200
planes for the refuelling of the Royal Air Force (RAF).


Crisis-hit jet maker Airbus received a huge boost on Thursday
when two customers pledged new orders worth 23 billion euros (30
billion dollars).


Qatar Airways said it planned to buy 80 A350 jets, one of the
biggest orders in the history of Airbus, and Russian airline
Aeroflot said it would sign a deal for 22 more of the same
aircraft.


On Friday, tens of thousands of workers at Airbus are expected to
walk off the job Friday in a highly unusual show of Europe-wide
union power against plans by the struggling aircraft manufacturer
to slash 10,000 posts.
