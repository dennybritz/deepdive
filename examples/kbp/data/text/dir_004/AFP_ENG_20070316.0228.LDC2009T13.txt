Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, whose contract at Arsenal is up
at the end of the season, was reported Friday to be eyeing a move
back home to Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin.


While Hertha don't have the financial means to pay Lehmann's
reported four million euro annual salary the club hopes to secure
a private investor to meet the outlay, according to the report in
Friday's Bild newspaper.


If the move goes ahead the 37-year-old will replace Hertha keeper
Christian Fiedler.


None of the parties concerned were willing to comment on the move
to the newspaper but last month Lehmann told Kicker magazine that
"the Bundesliga and Spain are the alternatives" if as expected he
quits the Gunners.
