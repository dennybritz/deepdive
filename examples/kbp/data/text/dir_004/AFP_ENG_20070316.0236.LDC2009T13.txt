Tanzania coach Marcio Maximo on Friday named his 20-man squad to
play Senegal in a crucial Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on
March 24.


The Taifa Stars travel to Dakar after two months of intensive
preparations, which included a month-long training stint in
Brazil.


Maximo, a Brazilian national, said he had prepared the team
physically, mentally and psychologically.


"I cannot predict the results but I believe the hard work will do
us good," said Maximo, who is expected to lead the team to
Senegal on Monday for his second away international match since
taking over as Tanzania's coach.


"I respect Senegal and of course they remain favourites and we
are underdogs. But nothing is impossible. We also have our
chances of winning."


The Stars will be playing their third match in the qualifying
tournament after beating Burkina Faso 2-1 in Dar es Salaam and
playing out a goal-less draw with Mozambique in Maputo last year
to top Group Seven.
