KarstadtQuelle, the German retailer and department store
operator, is threatening to shed more stores if they fail to meet
profitability targets this year, the Financial Times Deutschland
reported on Friday.


After already selling 74 stores in 2005 as part of a drastic
programme to return to profit, KarstadtQuelle has now identified
a further 27 stores out of the remaining 90 that the group will
only hold on to if they fulfill certain targets this year, the
newspaper said quoting internal company documents.


Among the stores are those in the German towns of Hamburg-
Harburg, Bayreuth, Magdeburg and Siegen, FT Deutschland said.


"This is not a sale list," it quoted a company spokesman as
saying.


"The stores have been categorised as improvement-worthy and will
therefore receive special support," he said.


The newspaper quoted insiders as saying that KarstadtQuelle has
long been wanting to focus on a small number of flagship stores.
And chairman Thomas Middlehoff recently indicated that not all
stores would be maintained, it added.
