Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa will pay a state visit to
neighbouring Namibia next week, his first to the southwest
African country since he became president in 2001.


"President Mwanawasa will arrive on Tuesday for a five-day state
visit and will be special guest of honour during Namibia's
independence celebrations on Wednesday," said Namibian foreign
ministry spokesman Isack Hamata.


The celebrations to mark the 17th anniversary of Namibia's
independence will take place in the coastal town of Swakopmund,
370 kilometres (230 miles) west of the capital Windhoek.


Several cabinet ministers will accompany Mwanawasa and bilateral
talks with his host, President Hifikepunye Pohamba, will take
place on transport, mining energy and education after his arrival
on Tuesday.


"The signing of several agreements will be done directly after
the negotiations to be followed by a state banquet," Hamata said.
