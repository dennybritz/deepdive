World oil prices edged up on Friday as traders weighed up the
impact of a decision by the OPEC crude producers' cartel to keep
its production levels steady.


The price of Brent North Sea crude for May delivery added nine
cents to 60.77 dollars per barrel in electronic trading.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in April, gained 24 cents to 57.79 dollars per barrel in
electronic deals before the official opening of the US market.


Crude futures had fallen on Thursday after OPEC maintained its
daily output target at 25.8 million barrels after a ministerial
meeting in Vienna, arguing that global supply levels were
healthy.


"OPEC's agreement to leave production restraints unchanged was
widely anticipated, but the impact of the decision is still being
debated," said Deutsche Bank analyst, Adam Siemski.


The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Counties supplies
more than one third of global crude.
