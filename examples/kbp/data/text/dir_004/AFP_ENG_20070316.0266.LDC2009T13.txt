The Korea Football Association on Friday urged world football
governing body FIFA to review the suspension of star striker Park
Chu-Young, penalised for violent conduct last month.


Park was suspended for three matches by FIFA after he was red
carded for retaliating against a Yemeni player who tackled him
hard in an Olympic qualifying match here.


"The act by Park was not severe enough to deserve a three-match
suspension," said Kim Joo-Sung, director for international
affairs at the Korean Football Association. "We decided to ask
FIFA to review the ruling."


"Suspension of one or two matches would be enough. We want to
know the exact reason why Park received so many suspensions," Kim
was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.


"Of course, Park did not play decently, but there has never been
a three-match suspension in similar European cases," Senol
Guenes, coach of Park's team, FC Seoul, told reporters in a news
conference.


"We have to know exactly on what grounds such a penalty was made
by FIFA."
