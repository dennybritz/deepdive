Unidentified gunmen opened fire on a convoy carrying Benin
President Yayi Boni, wounding several security guards but leaving
the president unhurt, officials said Friday.


The incident happened in the centre of the country late on
Thursday.


"The head of state is unharmed", said presidential advisor Edga
Guididi.


"Unfortunately, in the exchange of fire between the presidential
guard and the attackers several members of the presidential guard
were wounded", he said in a televised interview.
