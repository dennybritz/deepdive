President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed on Friday that Iran would not
go back on its sensitive nuclear work, as world powers agreed on
new sanctions on Iran, the semi-official Fars news agency
reported.


"The Iranian nation possesses the nuclear fuel cycle and will not
go back on that," he told a rally in Yazd province in central
Iran.


Six major world powers on Thursday agreed on a package of broader
UN sanctions against Iran for its repeated refusal to suspend
uranium enrichment, a process that can be used to make nuclear
fuel as well as atomic weapons.
