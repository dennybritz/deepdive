England have picked injured quick James Anderson for their World
Cup Group C opener against New Zealand here Friday.


The Lancashire fast bowler was named on the team sheet despite
the injury to the little finger of his right hand suffered during
catching practice on Wednesday.


Anderson, one of England's more experienced one-day bowlers, was
given the all clear after taking part in England training on
Thursday.


The 24-year-old, who bowls right-handed and bats left, sent down
several deliveries on the outfield at a reasonable pace and
afterwards an England spokesman said he had come through the
session without any discomfort.
