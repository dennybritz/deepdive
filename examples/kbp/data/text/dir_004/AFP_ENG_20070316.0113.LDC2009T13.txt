The Afghan driver of a kidnapped Italian journalist was killed
after being found guilty of spying, a man claiming to be a top
Taliban commander's spokesman told an Afghan news agency Friday.


The fate of Italian Daniele Mastrogiacomo and a second Afghan
captured March 4 would be decided late Friday, the independent
Pajhwok Afghan News agency cited the man, identified as
Shahbuddin Atal, as saying.


Pahjwok described Atal as a "purported spokesman for Taliban
commander Mullah Dadullah."


AFP could not independently confirm he was a spokesman for
Dadullah, said to be the Taliban's operational commander in the
south.


Dadullah said in an interview with AFP last Saturday that the
Italian would be killed in seven days unless Italy agreed to
withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and two captured Taliban
spokesman were released.


An AFP correspondent who has been in contact with Dadullah could
not reach him by telephone Friday to confirm the Pajhwok report.


Yousuf Ahmadi, who regularly speaks to the media on behalf of the
Taliban, told AFP earlier Friday the movement would extend its
deadline on the request of the Italians they were negotiating
with.


He said there had been progress in the talks.


The Pahjwok report cited Atal as saying the Afghan driver was
executed after being found guilty of spying for foreign troops.


The fate of the Italian and other Afghan would be decided in the
evening, he was cited as saying.


He said the Taliban were demanding the release of six men, the
report said, but did not say who these men were.
