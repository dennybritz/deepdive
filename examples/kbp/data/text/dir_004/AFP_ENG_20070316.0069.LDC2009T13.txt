President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad vowed on Friday that Iran would not
go back on its sensitive nuclear work, as world powers agreed on
new sanctions on Iran, the semi-official Fars news agency
reported.


"The Iranian nation possesses the nuclear fuel cycle and will not
go back on that," he told a rally in Yazd province in central
Iran.


Six major world powers on Thursday agreed on a package of broader
UN sanctions against Iran for its repeated refusal to suspend
uranium enrichment, a process that can be used to make nuclear
fuel as well as atomic weapons.


"Don't think you can block Iranian nation's pathway with these
sittings and meetings," Ahmadinejad told world powers.


Ambassadors from the six countries announced a deal on a new
sanctions resolution that was submitted to the Security Council's
10 non-permanent members ahead of a vote expected next week.


Ahmadinejad has formally asked to attend the Council meeting when
the sanctions come up for a vote although he slammed the world
body as "illegitimate" earlier on Thursday.


The new UN draft resolution builds on the sanctions imposed by
the Security Council in December on Iran's nuclear and missile
programmes after it ignored UN demands to freeze uranium
enrichment.


Iran says it only wants to enrich uranium for peaceful energy
ends, vehemently denying US and Israeli charges that it is
secretly seeking to develop atomic weapons.
