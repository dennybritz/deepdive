A civilian was killed and seven others hurt Friday in a landmine
explosion triggered by suspected rebels near a bus terminal in
Indian-administered Kashmir, police said.


"The explosion took place in (northern) Baramulla town," a police
spokesman said. Police said the apparent target was an army
convoy that had just passed the site.


"Three of the injured were seriously hurt," the spokesman said,
adding the explosion took place shortly before noon.


The area has been sealed off and searches launched for militants.


Kashmir is in the grip of a 17-year-old insurgency against Indian
rule that has so far left more than 44,000 people dead.
