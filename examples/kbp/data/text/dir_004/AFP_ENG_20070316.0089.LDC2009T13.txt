Hong Kong share prices closed little changed Friday after a
choppy session as investors turned cautious ahead of  results
announcements from blue chip heavyweights next week, dealers
said.


The market opened lower on worries over possible economic
tightening measures in China but recovered soon on hopes of solid
earnings from China Mobile and some short-covering activity.


Another late turn, saw the market slip back as investors were
reluctant to take fresh positions ahead of the weekend.


Losses on the mainland and Tokyo bourses also weighed on
sentiment.


Hutchison Whampoa, Cheung Kong, China Mobile and PetroChina are
among the companies due to announce their 2006 results next week.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 15.94 points at 18,953.50, after
a low of 18,770.28 and a high of 19,130.10, on turnover of 43.35
billion dollars (5.56 billion US).


For the week, the Hang Seng Index was down 181.38 points or 0.95
percent, marking the third straight weekly fall.
