The Iranian military has developed a new air defence system with
a boosted ability to hit targets by firing two missiles
simultaneously, state radio said on Friday.


"This new air defence system which can shoot one or two missiles
simultaneously... has been designed by army ground forces and
tested successfully," the radio said.


"It has high mobility and flexibility, and can pursue aerial
targets in any climate. Simultaneous firing increases the chances
of defence missiles hitting" their targets, it added.


Iran is heading for a showdown with the UN Security Council over
its disputed nuclear programme, which the West fears could be
diverted towards weapons development.


Tehran vehemently denies the charges, insisting that its atomic
programme of uranium enrichment is peaceful in nature.


Iranian leaders have repeatedly said the country's armed forces
are ready for any eventuality in the current nuclear stand-off.


"If our bullying enemy wants to do something insane, it will
surely be taken by surprise," army chief Major General Ataollah
Salehi said on Friday, in remarks quoted by the official IRNA
news agency.


The United States, which accuses Iran of seeking a nuclear
weapon, has never ruled out a military option to halt Tehran's
atomic drive.


Israel also considers the nuclear programme to be an "existential
threat" after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad repeatedly
called for the Jewish state to be wiped off the map.


Its Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said Israel did not "rule out"
taking military steps against Iran.


Israel is believed to be the region's sole if undeclared nuclear
power.
