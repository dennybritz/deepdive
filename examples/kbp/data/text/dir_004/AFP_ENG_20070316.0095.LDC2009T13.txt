Disgraced dotcom tycoon Takafumi Horie was released on bail
Friday pending an appeal, hours after he was convicted in a fraud
scandal, a court said.


The Tokyo District Court sentenced Horie on Friday to two and a
half years in prison on charges he conspired to falsely report
profits to hide losses at his once high-flying Livedoor firm.


Horie immediately filed an appeal with the Tokyo High Court. The
District Court decided to release him on bail of 500 million yen
(4.25 million dollars), the court's spokesman said.


As he had already paid 300 million yen for his first bail
following his arrest, Horie submitted an additional 200 million
yen to be released again, the spokesman said.


The flamboyant 34-year-old entrepreneur, who was once hailed as a
harbinger of a new, brasher Japanese corporate culture, has
steadfastly denied any wrongdoing and called his trial revenge by
the establishment.
