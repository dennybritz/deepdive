French presidential candidate Francois Bayrou, who makes
political hay of his rural roots, is to be reunited with a
restored 1952 tractor that belonged to his father.


Students at an agriculture school in the northwestern region of
Beauce offered to fix up the rusting Massey-Harris Pony three
years ago during a visit by Bayrou, who was then campaigning in
regional elections.


"It arrived in a pitiful state. The motor didn't work and
repairing it was a real challenge," the Parisien newspaper quoted
a teacher at the agriculture school as saying on Friday.


A team of eight students have been working for over a year to
restore the tractor, hunting down parts on the Internet and
sprucing it up with red and yellow paint. They managed to get it
running again this past week.


Born into a family of farmers from the southwestern Bearn region
of France, Bayrou still lives on his childhood farm, where he
breeds horses and owns several tractors.


A challenger in the April-May election who has enjoyed a
spectacular climb in the polls over the past two months, Bayrou
insisted in a recent documentary on French television to be
filmed riding a tractor.


In his recently-released book "Project for Hope", which is on the
best-seller list, the 55-year-old teacher said supporters have
been giving him model tractors as gifts.
