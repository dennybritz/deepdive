Oil-rich Abu Dhabi will become the first Gulf Arab city to host a
production of Verdi's "Aida" later this month as it forges ahead
with a drive to become a top- notch tourism destination.


A 300-strong cast will perform the March 29 opera in the open air
in the gardens of the Emirates Palace hotel in the capital of the
United Arab Emirates, the official WAM news agency reported on
Friday.


Up to 4,000 people will be able to attend a spectacle enhanced by
hi-tech sound and special pyrotechnic effects, it said.


This will be the first time the famous opera has been performed
in one of the conservative Muslim Gulf Arab states, WAM added.


Abu Dhabi is actively pumping petrodollars into a campaign to
attract cultural icons as it looks to tap into a growing regional
tourism market.


Earlier this month Abu Dhabi, the largest and wealthiest of the
seven emirates comprising the UAE, signed a deal to establish a
satellite of France's prestigious Louvre museum on a nearby
island that will also host a Guggenheim museum of contemporary
art.


Dubai, another UAE member, is already a thriving business and
tourism hub.
