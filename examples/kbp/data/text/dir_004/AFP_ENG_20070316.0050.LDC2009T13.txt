Indonesia is the world's fastest destroyer of forests,
eradicating 300 football fields' worth every hour, environmental
group Greenpeace said Friday as it staged a demonstration.


Activists dressed as loggers chain-sawed a 20-metre (65-foot)
wooden wall in the capital, Jakarta, to symbolise the
destruction, saying industrial and illegal logging were mainly to
blame.


Greenpeace said data from the UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation showed Indonesia destroyed nearly 1.9 million
hectares (4.6 million acres) of forest annually between 2000 and
2005.


But the official Indonesian figure was higher at 2.8 million
hectares, it said.


Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaigner Hapsoro said a series of
recent Indonesian natural disasters, such as floods, landslides
and droughts, were all linked to the "unprecedented destruction"
of forest cover.


"The government must realise that massive forest degradation in
Indonesia is responsible for major disasters that killed a lot of
Indonesians," he said.


Only Brazil destroys more forest annually, but Indonesia's
smaller forest area puts its deforestation rate at 2 percent
against Brazil's 0.6 percent, the group said.


Greenpeace said it had written to the Guinness World Records to
nominate Indonesia as the fastest destroyer of forests, based on
its deforestation rate.
