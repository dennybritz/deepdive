South Korea will begin shipping fertiliser aid to North Korea
this month, Red Cross authorities said here Friday, as a stand-
off over the North's nuclear weapons programmes eased.


"We will start shipping fertiliser aid to North Korea from March
27," Han Wan- Sang, president of the Korean Red Cross, told
journalists.


North Korea's Red Cross has asked for 300,000 tonnes of
fertiliser from the South in time for the spring planting season.


South Korea's unification ministry has said it would resume
massive food and fertiliser aid to the impoverished country after
an agreement was reached at six-party talks on dismantling North
Korea's nuclear programmes last month.


Following the February 13 accord, the two sides resumed high-
level bilateral talks and agreed to restart family reunions and a
series of other steps to improve relations.


The two countries -- still technically at war -- have pledged
efforts smoothly to implement the six-nation agreement, under
which North Korea will disable its nuclear programmes in return
for aid and diplomatic benefits.
