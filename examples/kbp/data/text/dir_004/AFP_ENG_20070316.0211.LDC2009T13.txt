America's 2000 Olympic 100 metres champion Maurice Greene and
China's 2004 Olympic 110 metres hurdles titleholder Liu Xiang
will be among the stars featuring in the Osaka Grand Prix on May
5 it was announced by the organisers.


The US star has won the 100 metres three times in Osaka but has
not competed for the last two years, disgraced compatriot Justin
Gatlin has won it both times.


The 32-year-old Greene, the Sydney Olympic gold medallist, has
been overshadowed in recent years by world and Olympic champion
Gatlin.


Gatlin is currently seeking an arbitration hearing in the United
States after he was slapped with an eight-year ban for a doping
offence last year.


Liu caused a sensation at the Athens Olympics by equalling the
world record of 12.91 seconds in the men's 110-metre hurdles,
becoming the first Olympic champion from Asia in a track event.


Liu also set a new world record of 12.88 in Lausanne in July last
year, breaking previous co-holder Colin Jackson's mark.


Among the other stars set to compete in Osaka are Olympic and
world 400m champion Jeremy Wariner from the United States.
