The orbit of the International Space Station (ISS) was
successfully corrected on Friday, the Interfax news agency
reported.


Igor Panarin, a spokesman for the Russian space agency Roskosmos,
was cited as saying the engines on the cargo vessel Progress
docked on the ISS fired up for the expected time and raised the
station's orbit by about five kilometres (3.1 miles).


The correction, which gives the ISS a new orbit of about 337
kilometres (209 miles), was necessary to put the station in the
best position for the manned Soyuz TMA-10 spacecraft to dock
there in April.


That mission will carry a "space tourist", Hungarian-born
American billionaire Charles Simonyi, as well as two Russian
astronauts, Fedor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov.


In February, two spacemen on board the ISS carried out a
successful six-hour space walk to fix the antennae on the
Progress M-58 supply ship.


Last October the antennae caused problems when the vessel docked
and it could have also hampered its departure in April, just
before the ISS crew is changed.


The ISS's orbit has to be periodically corrected as the space
station sinks as it circles the earth.
