The agent of Chelsea's England international Frank Lampard held
talks with Juventus in London this week, according to a newspaper
report here on Friday.


Steve Kutner appeared in a photograph in La Gazzetta dello Sport
in discussion with Juventus' sporting director Alessio Secco and
Roberto Bettega, the club's transfer consultant. The meeting
reportedly took place on Wednesday.


Kutner told the paper: "When Lampard signed his last contract
with Chelsea Juventus were pressing hard to buy him.


"But he held firm as he didn't succeed in getting the same
treatment as players of the calibre of (Juan Sebastian) Veron and
(Hernan) Crespo.


"It's good when a team succeeds in putting pressure on your
employers."


He added: "Peter Kenyon (Chelsea's chief executive) knows what we
want and knows that Frank has enormous potential."


Lampard, 28, is currently in negotiations with Premiership
champions Chelsea about extending his existing contract beyond
2008.


The England midfielder grabbed his 20th goal of the season in
Wednesday's 1-0 Premiership win at Manchester City, underscoring
again how important he is to the club.


But Friday's report points out that Lampard's fee could prove a
sticking point again for a club that is sitting top of Serie B
after last season's relegation.


Juve will also be deprived of money spinning appearances in the
Champions League next season.
