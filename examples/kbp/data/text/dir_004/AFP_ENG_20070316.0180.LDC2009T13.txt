Police in Budapest held 36 people for questioning following
violent clashes on Hungary's national day, officials said on
Friday.


Five people, including four police officers, were wounded in the
riots on Thursday night, which the authorities said caused about
70,000 euros (93,000 dollars) worth of damage in the Hungarian
capital.


The day began with a peaceful demonstration by about 200,000
people to mark Hungary's 1948 revolution against Habsburg rule,
but later hundreds of skinheads and far-right protestors took to
the streets.


Some wore masks and chanted Nazi slogans. Barricades were set up
using up-turned cars that were then set on fire, as well as
benches, ripped up telephone cabins and hundreds of burned out
dustbins.


Cleaners removed about 200 cubic metres (10,600 cubic foot) of
rubbish following the protests, which were dispersed by police
using water canons and tear gas late on Thursday evening.


Last autumn more than 200 people were wounded when similar riots
took place on the margins of a peaceful demonstration organised
by conservative opposition party Fidesz.
