A man made homeless after NATO's 1999 bombing destroyed his flat
in Serbia has died following a 39-day hunger strike, a daily said
Friday.


Milivoje Stamenkovic, 60, died of a heart attack during a protest
along with seven other hunger-strikers in front of the town hall
in the southern city of Nis, said the Press newspaper.


The group has been demanding the Serbian government fulfills a
promise to provide them with apartments to replace those
destroyed during NATO's three- month aerial bombardment of the
country over Kosovo.


They have been living in provisional accommodation since the
bombing campaign, which helped drive out forces loyal to former
president Slobodan Milosevic waging a brutal crackdown against
Kosovo Albanians.
