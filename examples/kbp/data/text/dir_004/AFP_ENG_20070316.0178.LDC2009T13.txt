A dozen detainees escaped from a British military prison in
southern Iraq, a security source said on Friday.


The security source in Basra said the detainees escaped from the
prison in the Shuaiba military base, west of the southern city of
Basra.


It was not immediately clear when or how the prisoners escaped.


British military spokesman Major David Gell confirmed that there
had been an escape but gave no details.


"We are aware of the incident and it is now under investigation.
We will make a statement soon," he told AFP.


The security source said the prisoners had been held without
charge for the past two years. Thousands of Iraqis are held in US
and British run prisons across Iraq for security reasons.
