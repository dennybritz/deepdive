NATO troops opened fire on a police patrol in southern
Afghanistan, apparently mistaking them for hostile forces, and
killed five policemen, a senior police official said Friday.


Another six policemen were missing after the shooting late
Thursday in the volatile Gereshk area of the southern province of
Helmand, provincial deputy police chief General Isau Khan told
AFP.


They had been travelling in a vehicle that was not a conventional
police type, he said.


The media office of NATO's International Security Assistance
Force could not confirm the incident.


However, a military official in southern Afghanistan said on
condition of anonymity that there had been an incident between
NATO forces and the police overnight which was believed to have
caused police casualties.


The circumstances of the incident were unclear, the official
added.
