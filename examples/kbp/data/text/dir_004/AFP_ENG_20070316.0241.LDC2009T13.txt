US consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in February, the Labor
Department said Friday, signaling inflation slightly above market
expectations.


The consumer price index (CPI) was stronger than the 0.3 percent
expected by Wall Street analysts.


But the "core" CPI index, which excludes volatile food and energy
costs, was up a more modest 0.2 percent, in line with market
forecasts.


Over the past 12 months, consumer prices have risen 2.4 percent
and the core index is up 2.7 percent.
