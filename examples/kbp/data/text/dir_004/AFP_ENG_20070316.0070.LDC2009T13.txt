France's defence minister arrived here Friday for talks on ways
to strengthen bilateral cooperation and exchanges, officials of
South Korea's defence ministry said.


Michele Alliot-Marie was to meet with her South Korean
counterpart Kim Jang-Soo later Friday to discuss ways to enhance
defence cooperation between the two countries, the ministry said.


"The French defence minister's trip comes as South Korea and
France are stepping up efforts for closer ties in various defence
fields," said ministry spokesman Colonel Kang Yong-Hee.


During her three-day stay, Alliot-Marie will also meet with
President Roh Moo- hyun on Sunday, tour the inter-Korean border
and meet with French business leaders here.


South Korea signed a contract last year with Eurocopter, a
subsidiary of European aerospace and defence giant EADS, to
produce 245 military transport helicopters in a technolgy tie-up.


The project is worth a total of 6.0-8.0 billion dollars.


Alliot-Marie, who also visited Japan on her current Asian swing,
will leave for China on Sunday.
