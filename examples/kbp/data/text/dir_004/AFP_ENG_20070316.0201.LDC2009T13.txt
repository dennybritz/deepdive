A former ally of late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic has died
days after being charged with siphoning off state money to Cyprus
in the 1990s, a report said Friday.


Jovan Zebic, one of the late strongman's closest aides during his
autocratic regime, died in the capital Belgrade on Thursday
night, said the state-run Tanjug news agency.


The report cited the Socialist Party of Milosevic, who himself
died in a cell of the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague a year ago.


It was confirmed to private B92 radio by the Socialists' leader,
Ivica Dacic.


The death of Zebic, 67, came two days he was charged with
embezzling millions of dollars from state coffers by Serbian
prosecutors along with two other former Milosevic henchmen.


They were former prime minister Nikola Sainovic, who is currently
on trial before the ICTY, and former customs chief Mihalj Kertes,
who is already in a Serbian jail over links to organised crime.


The United States Treasury has estimated that during his rule,
Milosevic's allies deposited more than four billion dollars in
Cyprus.


Most of the money was used to finance Milosevic's Socialist Party
or to fill holes in the state budget, which was substantially
limited by international sanctions imposed on Belgrade during his
rule.
