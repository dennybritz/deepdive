Japan on Friday halted a nuclear power plant after the operator
admitted it covered up an accident, officials said.


Resource-poor Japan relies on nuclear power for 30 percent of its
needs, but reactors frequently encounter public resistance due to
safety concerns including a series of cover-up scandals.


Hokuriku Electric Power Co. acknowledged Thursday it failed to
report an accident in June 1999 when a reactor experienced
uncontrollable chain reactions for 15 minutes.


It halted the plant Friday in Ishikawa prefecture, 300 kilometers
(200 miles) north of Tokyo, under government orders and would
conduct a "comprehensive security checkup," a statement said.


The accident did not cause any harm to workers or the
environment, according to the government and the power company.


But it took place three months before one of Japan's worst
nuclear accidents, when two workers were killed and 600 people
exposed to radiation at the Tokaimura uranium plant northeast of
Tokyo.


Industry Minister Akira Amari said that a prompt reporting of the
earlier incident could have prevented the deadly incident, which
also involved a chain reaction.


"It is extremely regrettable," Amari told reporters. "If the
accident had been disclosed immediately, (the Tokaimura case)
could have been prevented."


The company said the June 1999 accident was caused when workers
mishandled a system to control water pressure for moving reactor
control rods.


Isao Nagahara, president of the power company, met the local
governor Friday to offer an apology, a prefectural official said.
