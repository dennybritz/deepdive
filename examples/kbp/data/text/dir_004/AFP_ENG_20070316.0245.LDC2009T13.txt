UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will pay an official visit to
Lebanon on March 30, a government source told AFP on Friday.


"During his visit, Mr Ban will be received by (Prime Minister
Fuad) Siniora," the source said.


It will be the first trip to Lebanon by the new UN chief, who
took over from Kofi Annan on January 1.


Ban is due to visit Egypt on March 23, probably followed by
Riyadh where he has been invited by Arab League chief Amr Mussa
to attend an Arab summit on March 28 and 29.


Lebanon's four-month-long political crisis will be one of the
major topics discussed at the Riyadh summit.


Predominantly Sunni Saudi Arabia supports the Western-backed
Siniora government in Beirut, while the opposition in Lebanon is
led by the Shiite Hezbollah movement backed by Iran and Syria.


Arab diplomatic sources in Riyadh told AFP on Tuesday that Saudi
Arabia was working on hosting a reconciliation meeting next week
between Lebanon's anti- Syrian parliamentary majority and the
largely pro-Damascus opposition.


Such a meeting would depend on the attitude of Syria, the former
powerbroker in Lebanon. Relations between Riyadh and Damascus are
currently at an all-time low.


On Wednesday, the UN chief told the Security Council that he was
concerned about reports of arms smuggling from Syria to Lebanon,
and he also asked Israel to stop its warplanes from entering
Lebanese airspace in breach of Resolution 1701 which ended last
year's 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah.
