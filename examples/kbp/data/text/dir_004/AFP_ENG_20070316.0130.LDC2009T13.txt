Brazil, India, the European Union and the United States need to
put concrete offers on the table in WTO trade talks if
negotiations are to succeed by June, EU trade chief Peter
Mandelson said Friday.


"We need to see those numbers" on reductions in farm support and
agriculture and industrial tariffs, the EU trade commissioner
said at the European Business Summit in Brussels.


"It is the responsibility of the G4 to put the numbers on the
table," he said, referring to the four big players in the current
round of World Trade Organisation negotiations.


Mandelson warned that "the clock is ticking" for progress to be
made in the talks with the US administration's powers to
negotiate trade deals set to expire at the end of June.


WTO negotiators are struggling to revive the faltering round of
talks on breaking down barriers to trade in agriculture, services
and industrial goods which were launched in the Qatari capital
Doha in 2001.


An agreement between the world's two biggest trading powers, the
US and EU, and the two leading developing or emerging nations
Brazil and India, is widely regarded as crucial to the hopes of
brokering a compromise among the WTO's 150 members this year.
