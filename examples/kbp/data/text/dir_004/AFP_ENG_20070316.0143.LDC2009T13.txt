A Russian court has ordered Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime
minister and now a prominent opposition figure, to return a
luxury country home he bought from the state shortly before he
left office, domestic media reported on Friday.


"The court ordered the return of the state dacha to state
property," the Interfax news agency quoted a court spokeswoman as
saying.


The decision comes after another court ruled on February 2 that
Kasyanov's acquisition of the country home -- known as a "dacha"
in Russia -- was illegal.


Kasyanov served as prime minister during President Vladimir
Putin's first term before he was replaced in 2004. Critics say he
bought the dacha at a fraction of its real market value shortly
before he left office.


Kasyanov, who has become a vocal critic of Putin and has
announced plans to stand in Russia's presidential elections next
year, has called the court challenges to his ownership of the
property "political" and "unfounded".


Reacting to Friday's court ruling, Kasyanov said he had expected
it.


"It has been obvious since the complaint was first considered a
year ago that the final decision would be baseless," he told Ekho
Moskvy radio.
