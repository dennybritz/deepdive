Meningitis has killed some 1,670 people this year in a string of
African countries despite an extensive vaccination campaign, the
World Health Organisation said on Friday.


The deaths amount to more than a tenth of the 15,595 cases
reported in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan
and Uganda, the WHO said in a statement.


In Burkina Faso, 4,958 cases have been reported and 432 deaths.


A mass vaccination campaign in the West African country was
launched last month but hit a snag after it ran out of vaccines,
forcing the government to launch an international appeal for the
drugs.


Burkina Faso sits on the so-called "meningitis belt" that runs
from the southern Sahara in Senegal to Ethiopia, and whose total
population is estimated at 300 million.


The International Coordinating Group (ICG) for meningitis
vaccines has already released 530,000 doses in Burkina Faso, the
WHO said.


In northern Uganda, there have been 2,961 cases including 105
deaths. For Sudan and the DR Congo, the figures are 6,946 cases
and 430 deaths, and 730 cases and 84 deaths respectively.


Around 1.5 million people in affected countries have been
targeted in mass vaccination campaigns organised by national
authorities, the WHO, Medicins Sans Frontieres and other non-
governmental organisations.


Meningitis is an often fatal airborne infection, transmitted
through sneezing and coughing, that infects the brain and spinal
cord. Its symptoms include fever, rashes and vomiting.
