Unidentified gunmen opened fire on a convoy carrying Benin
President Yayi Boni, in an attack that wounded several security
guards but left the president unhurt, officials said Friday.


The incident happened late on Thursday in the centre of the small
west African country.


"The head of state is unharmed," presidential advisor Edga
Guididi said in a television interview.


"Unfortunately, in the exchange of fire between the presidential
guard and the attackers several members of the presidential guard
were wounded."


The attack, the circumstances of which remain vague, comes less
than 10 days ahead of legislative elections that will be Boni's
first major electoral test.


It happened in the region of Parakou, a town some 400 kilometres
(250 miles) north of Cotonou. Boni's home town, Tchaourou, lies
some 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Parakou.


Boni was completely unknown in politics and his election in early
2006 came as a surprise and displeased many political
heavyweights in the country.


"Just how far will the mafia go in preventing him (Boni) from
carrying out the mission the people gave him?" Guididi said.


Other sources in the country however suggested the attackers
might well have been highway robbers who attacked the vehicles
before realizing rthey were part of the presidential convoy.


Even the presidential advisor said in his television interview
that the attack had been carried out "as if it was a hold-up".
