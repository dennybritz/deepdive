Indian shares closed 0.9 percent lower on Friday as investors
unwound positions ahead of the weekend on fears of a further
weakening of global markets, dealers said.


They said sentiment was also hit by concerns of more monetary
tightening after India's inflation jumped for a second straight
week to 6.46 percent for the week ended March 3.


India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, will hold a
policy meeting on April 24.


The 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex index fell 113.45
points to 12,430.40.


At Friday's close, the Sensex has fallen 15.5 percent from its
all-time peak of 14,723.88 hit on February 9.


"Investors are nervous as there's no clarity on which way global
markets will move next week. Higher inflation has raised fears of
a further tightening in monetary policy," said Advait Date,
dealer with brokerage BHH Securities.
