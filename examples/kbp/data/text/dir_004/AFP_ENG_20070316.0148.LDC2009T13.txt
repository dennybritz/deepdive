Russia is threatening to close its air space to EU airlines which
continue to breach regulations, Russian news agencies reported on
Friday, quoting the federal air navigation regulator.


The agency had written to the European civil aviation conference
asking the European Union to take "urgent measures" to improve
control of flights through Russian air space.


The complaint was based on a study of flights in the Moscow area
between June 2006 and February 2007 which showed that the
airlines targeted had breached air traffic procedures on 18
occasions and on five occasions had flown over "forbidden zones."


The letter was from the head of the Russian federal air
navigation agency Alexander Neradko to the president of European
civial aviation conference Michel Wachenheim.


It said that if European air authorities "do not take adequate
measures immediately to deal with this siuation", the Russian
agency would be "obliged to refuse to grant flight clearance for
flights over Russia by airlines" which had breached the rules.


The agency did not name the companies alleged to have breached
the rules, saying it did not want to "compromise their
reputation". The agency said that the breaches arose from a "lack
of discipline" and poor training of pilots.


Russian and European experts are due to meet on the issue.
