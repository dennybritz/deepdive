Bird flu has killed a 32-year-old woman in Indonesia, taking the
death toll in the nation worst hit by the disease to 65, the
health ministry said Friday.


"I confirm a woman died on March 14 from bird flu," I Nyoman
Kandun, a senior official at the health ministry, told AFP.


The woman was the 86th confirmed case of bird flu in Indonesia,
which detected its first human sufferer in the middle of 2005.
