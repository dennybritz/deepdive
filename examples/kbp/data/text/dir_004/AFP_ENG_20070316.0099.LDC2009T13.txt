A fugitive rebel in East Timor held a mystical ritual to draw on
the power of a dead leader before eluding an attack by Australian
troops, a report said.


Major Alfredo Reinado and locals in Same, where he was based,
gathered to give him the power of Dom Boaventura, a legendary
local freedom fighter, the Suara Timor Lorosae newspaper reported
this week.


"Viva Major Alfredo. Viva Boaventura," people were quoted as
shouting at the ceremony.


It reportedly took place in February before Australian troops
stormed the rebel's hideout in Same, which lies 50 kilometres (30
miles) south of the capital, Dili.


The town's residents believe a supernatural transfer of power
helped to blind Australian troops, allowing Reinado to escape and
elude a manhunt that is still ongoing, the report said.


In 1900 Boaventura staged a revolt in Same against Portuguese
colonists, but his forces were crushed in 1912.


There has been speculation that Reinado, a persistent thorn in
the side of East Timor's government, is trying to draw on
Boaventura's legend to boost his support in the region.


Reinado has been criticised for his role in deadly unrest in East
Timor last year, which killed at least 37 people and displaced
150,000, triggering the deployment of an Australian-led
international peacekeeping force.
