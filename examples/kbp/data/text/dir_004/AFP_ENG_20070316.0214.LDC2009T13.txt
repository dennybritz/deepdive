Pope Benedict XVI will visit Brazil May 9-14, the Vatican
officially announced Friday, confirming that he will visit Sao
Paolo and attend a conference of Latin American bishops in
Aparecida.


The trip will be the first of Benedict's nearly two-year-old
pontificate to the Americas.


The agenda of the 18-day Latin American Episcopal Conference will
include poverty and exclusion in Latin America, the proliferation
of evangelical sects competing with the Catholic Church, and the
impact of globalisation.
