Turkey on Friday invited bids for a 51-percent stake in state-run
petrochemicals company Petkim, in a fresh effort to revive the
troubled privatisation of the firm.


In an offer published in major newspapers, Turkey's privatisation
board set June 15 as the deadline to submit final bids.


In June 2003, Turkey auctioned off 88.86 percent of the company
to the controversial Uzan family empire for 605 million dollars
(454 million euros), but cancelled the sell-off two months later
after the Uzans failed to fulfil the required conditions amid
financial difficulties.


A second tender in August 2003 for the block sale of 88.86
percent failed in August 2003 for lack of investor interest.


In April 2005, 34.5 percent of the company's shares were sold to
Turkish and foreign investors in a public offering that raised
267 million dollars.


About 39 percent of Petkim shares are traded on the Istanbul
stock exchange.


Petkim controls one-third of the petrochemical market in Turkey
and employs about 4,000 people.


It posted a net profit of 41 million dollars in 2006.


Privatisation is a key element in Turkey's economic programme,
backed by a 10 -billion-dollar loan from the International
Monetray Fund, as it recovers from two severe financial crises in
1999 and 2001.
