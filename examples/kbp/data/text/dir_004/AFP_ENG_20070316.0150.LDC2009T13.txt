Bulgaria's parliament approved the nomination of a new European
affairs minister to replace Meglena Kuneva who became a European
Commissioner after Bulgaria joined the EU this year.


A total of 157 lawmakers in the 240-seat parliament voted for the
appointment of Deputy Foreign Minister Gergana Grancharova.


"It is very important that this year Bulgaria prove itself
capable to meet the challenges of European integration...
especially in critical areas," Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev
told parliament as he announced the nomination.


Grancharova, 33, entered parliament in 2001 as an MP for the
centrist National Movement Simeon II of former Prime Minister
Simeon Saxe Coburg. She has been deputy foreign minister since
2004.
