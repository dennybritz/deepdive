Champions Brisbane Broncos lost their opening match of the new
Australian National Rugby League season, going down to North
Queensland Cowboys 23-16 in Brisbane Friday.


Test scrum-half Johnathan Thurston inspired the Cowboys and
featured in all their three first-half tries for a 16-6 half-time
lead before a ground record 50,416 crowd at Lang Park.


Test fullback Karmichael Hunt, who was pitched in as the Broncos'
scrum-half, provided Brisbane's second half spark.


He scored in the 57th minute and then combined with Test skipper
Darren Lockyer and Tonie Carroll to send youngster Joel Moon over
in the 62nd.


Lockyer kicked the sideline conversion to level at 16-16, but not
to be outdone, Thurston's inside pass sent Matt Bowen on a 60m
run to the try-line seven minutes from fulltime.


Bowen sealed the all-Queensland derby with a 25m drop goal with
two minutes left.


Premiership favourites Melbourne Storm opened their season with a
tense 18-16 victory over the Wests Tigers in Melbourne.


The Storm prevailed in an entertaining encounter, with both sides
scoring three tries in a superb start to the NRL season.


While the Storm were the better side, they didn't have the match
all their own way as the Tigers' outstanding defence which kept
them in the game.
