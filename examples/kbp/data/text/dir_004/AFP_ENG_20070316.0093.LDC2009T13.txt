A roadside bomb targeting a passing police patrol killed two
policeman and a civilian on Friday in Iraq's northern oil hub of
Kirkuk, a police officer said.


Seven people, including three policemen, were wounded in the
blast in the eastern Al-Wadha district, said police Captain Imad
Jassim.


Insurgents have stepped up attacks in the past few months in
Kirkuk, an ethnically mixed city claimed both by Arabs and Kurds.
