Israeli president Moshe Katsav has created a non-profit
organisation to lobby Iranian-American Jews to help finance his
defence against rape charges, an Israeli newspaper reported on
Friday.


The newly created "The truth will burst forth" group will focus
its fundraising efforts on American Jews of Iranian origin, like
Katsav, the daily Maariv reported.


"Katsav is operating discreetly, without publicity, to ask
members of the Jewish community of Iranian origin to donate gifts
to finance his defence against the lawsuit," the newspaper
reported, quoting an anonymous philanthropist who had been asked
for money.


"He isn't getting the support he expected because -- given the
circumstances -- people fear being identified with him," the
source added, according Maariv.


Katsav has already spent tens of thousands of dollars on funding
his defence, the paper said, and the most significant costs are
still to come.


Katsav temporarily resigned from his largely ceremonial post at
the end of January after Israel's attorney general announced he
would charge him with rape, sexual harassment, obstruction of
justice and intimidating witnesses.


He faces up to 16 years in prison if found guilty.
