A powerful earthquake and aftershock that struck the Indonesian
island of Sumatra last week damaged more than 12,000 houses,
state media said Friday.


A total of 12,170 homes were damaged by the deadly 6.3-magnitude
quake and a subsequent aftershock, the Antara news agency said,
citing data from a disaster mitigation task force on Sumatra.


Some houses had collapsed entirely and nearly 3,800 were badly
damaged, Muslim Kasim, the head of the task force, was quoted as
saying.


The March 6 earthquakes also damaged more than 150 schools, a
similar number of places of worship and 14 roads and bridges, the
report said, adding government offices, hospitals and shops were
also hit.


About 70 people were killed and more than 1,700 displaced, Antara
said, without citing a source. An official on Sumatra had earlier
put the death toll at 66.


Indonesia, an archipelago of some 17,000 islands, sits on the so-
called Pacific Ring of Fire, where continental plates meet -- and
where earthquakes are a regular and often deadly occurrence.


The devastating Asian tsunami in 2004 was set off by a massive
earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, killing some 168,000 people
in Aceh province on its northern tip.
