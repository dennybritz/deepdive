Riot police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Islamabad on
Friday as demonstrations against the sacking of Pakistan's chief
justice intensified, AFP reporters said.


Loud blasts were heard as police in a camouflaged riot van fired
the projectiles at protesters who had hurled stones at them from
behind a roadworks embankment.


The protests erupted as top judge Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry
attended a hearing at the Supreme Court in the capital into
misconduct charges laid by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf,
who sacked him a week ago.
