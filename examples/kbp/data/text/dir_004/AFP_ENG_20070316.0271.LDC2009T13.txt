SEAT, the ailing Spanish subsidiary of German auto giant
Volkswagen, is planning further belt-tightening measures which
could include cutting 10 percent of its workforce -- or 1,300
jobs in all -- by 2009, a VW spokesman said on Friday.


The cuts would be implemented via voluntary redundancies and
early retirement, the spokesman said.


A final figure had not yet been agreed, with negotiations still
underway with unions, he added.


Analysts and industry experts have frequently speculated about
the future of SEAT which skidded into a loss of 62.5 million
euros (83 million dollars) in 2005 and also ran up a loss of 50
million euros last year, despite 660 job cuts.


In order to steer the unit back to profit, VW announced a 400
-million-euro investment programme earlier this month, including
the launch of two new models.


The German parent is also planning to boost productivity at
SEAT's Barcelona factory.


The Spanish car maker employs a total workforce of 13,000 in
Spain.
