At least six people died and two others were wounded on Friday
when a suspected landmine explosion shattered a makeshift house
in a town outside the Somali capital, residents said.


Locals in Afgoye, 20 kilometres (13 miles) west of Mogadishu,
said the explosion destroyed the building and amputated the legs
of a young girl inside.


"The six were killed when the device -- believed to be a landmine
-- exploded in the house," Hamud Mohamed, a neighbour said.


"The explosion was too loud and people thought it was a mortar,"
he added.


"The six died on the spot. Two people who were wounded and are in
very serious condition. One young girl lost her legs," said
Ibrahim Daud.


Police in Afgoye were probing the blast in the makeshift house of
one of thousands of families who have recently fled spiralling
violence in Mogadishu.


Insurgents have increased attacks in the Somali capital since
joint Ethiopian- Somali forces ousted an Islamist movement in
January.


The African Union last week deployed 1,200 Ugandan troops there,
part of a proposed 8,000-strong force aiming to enable Ethiopian
troops to leave and Somali forces to take over security.


Landmines and other weapons have been sold in Somalia openly
since January 1991, when dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled
and the country plunged into clan warfare.
