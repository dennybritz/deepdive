Lithuanian health officials imposed a quarantine on domestic
animals in the capital Vilnius on Friday after a dead fox
discovered in the city last week tested positive for rabies.


"Most household pets have been vaccinated against rabies but
there is still a risk of contamination," a medical assistant to
Maryte Kasperiuniene, a rabies specialist at a Vilnius hospital,
told AFP.


According to the LETA news agency, the quarantine will last for
at least two months, and the city authorities have ordered all
stray cats and dogs in the affected Old Town area to be put down.


"This is the third case of rabies in Vilnius this year," said
Kasperiuniene's assistant, who asked not to be named.


"Last year there were 33 cases of the disease in Vilnius.
Usually, rabies cases here involve wild animals that have
wandered into the city from the surrounding forests".


Vilnius authorities have urged anyone who might have come into
contact with the dead fox, which was found on March 7, to seek
medical advice.


Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system
and is most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal.


Although preventable, rabies still kills some 55,000 people a
year, mainly in developing countries.
