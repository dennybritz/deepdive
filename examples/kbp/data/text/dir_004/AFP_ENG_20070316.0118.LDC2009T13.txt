Azouz Begag, France's Minister for Equal Opportunities, said
Friday that he is supporting the centrist candidate Francois
Bayrou at next month's presidential election.


"He is the only candidate that I can support. We shall work out
how I express this support in the coming days," Begag said in a
radio interview.


"Democracy is not the tyranny of bipolarisation. The French want
to try something different. We need an encounter of the third
kind, and the third kind of Francois Bayrou," he said.


Begag, 50, is known to have fallen out with Nicolas Sarkozy,
Interior Minister and candidate for the ruling centre-right,
because of his policies on immigration.


The minister, who is of Algerian parents, said Sarkozy's recent
call for a "ministry of immigration and national identity" was
"indecent".


"It's a hook to catch the lost sheep of the National Front and
bring them back to the republican fold. It is offensive to
identity immigration with the risk of changing French identity,"
he said.


Bayrou, who leads the small Union for French Democracy (UDF)
party, has surged in the polls in recent weeks.


A BVA survey on Friday put him at 21 percent of the first-round
vote on April 22, behind Sarkozy on 29 percent and the socialist
Segolene Royal on 23 percent.


The decisive second round between the two leading contenders is
on May 6.
