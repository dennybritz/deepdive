French cosmetics companies Clarins and L'Occitane announced on
Friday they would team up to make acquisitions worth up to 500
million euros (666 million dollars).


"Clarins and L'Occitane plan to create a joint venture to put in
place a common policy of acquisitions with a global limit of 500
million euros," said Clarins finance director Pierre Milet.


"The capital of this company will be owned in equal parts (by
both companies)," he said, making it a 50-50 joint venture
between the groups.


In an interview with AFP on Thursday, the chairman of L'Occitane,
Reinold Geiger, said his company wanted to "begin to be
interested in possible external growth."


Clarins owns about 23.0 percent of L'Occitane but plans to sell
about 12 percent to management of the group.


L'Occitane makes natural cosmetics which are marketed using the
image of the Provence region of southeast France.


Clarins, known for its skincare products, employs nearly six
thousand employees and has sales of more than 600 million euros.
