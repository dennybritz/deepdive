Italian clothing company Benetton announced on Friday that it had
appointed a director from US record label Warner Music as its new
chief executive.


Caccia Dominioni, 52, is to take over on June 1 to replace
Silvano Cassano, who resigned late last year after a disagreement
with the Benetton family on the group's development strategy.


Caccia Dominioni is currently vice chairman and chief operating
officer of Warner Music International, part of Warner Music
Group, the company said.


Benetton cited the new CEO's experience in the fast-moving
entertainment sector as well as his ability to motivate a
management team as particularly important for his selection to
the post.


Caccia Dominioni has worked for Warner Music International for 10
years, Benetton said.
