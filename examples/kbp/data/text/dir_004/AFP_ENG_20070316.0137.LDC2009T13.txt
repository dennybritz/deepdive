SAP chief executive Henning Kagermann defended on Friday the
software maker's strategy of investing internally and expressed
dismay at the decline in the group's share price since the
beginning of the year.


Shares in the world's leading maker of business software have
fallen by around 15 percent since January after SAP announced
that planned investments of 300-400 million euros (399-530
million dollars) would weigh on profitability this year.


"The financial markets' reaction to our investment plans
surprises me," Kagermann told the Friday edition of the financial
daily Boersen-Zeitung.


"We announce that we'll invest 300-400 million euros of our own
money in a promising new product so as to grow organically -- and
the share price falls," the CEO complained.


Arch-rival Oracle, on the other hand, "is investing more than 20
billion dollars in buying more than 24 companies and Oracle's
market share is going to shrink nevertheless. But the markets
appear to ignore that," Kagermann continued.


The CEO reaffirmed SAP's strategy of focusing on organic growth.
A new software being developed for small and mid-sized companies
will enable the group to expand its client base from around
38,000 at present to 100,000 by 2010.


In a separate interview published in the Financial Times,
Kagermann insisted that "the stock will recover."
