Two more US soldiers have died in Iraq, one in a blast in
northern Salaheddin province, the military said Friday.


The soldier died of injuries sustained in the explosion during
combat operations on Thursday.


A marine died in a non-combat incident in western Anbar province
on Thursday, said a separate statement, without elaborating.


The military had on Thursday announced the deaths the same day of
four soldiers who died in twin roadside bombings while returning
from a cordon and search operation in eastern Baghdad.


The latest deaths brought the US military's losses in Iraq since
the March 2003 invasion to 3,211, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
