A coroner on Friday ruled that a British soldier who died in a
"friendly fire" incident by US forces during the Iraq war was
unlawfully killed and said his death was entirely avoidable.


Coroner Andrew Walker said the attack on Lance Corporal Matty
Hull's convoy near the start of the 2003 conflict was criminal,
and hit out at the US military for failing to co-operate with the
inquest.


"The attack on the convoy amounted to an assault. It was unlawful
because there was no lawful reason for it and in that respect it
was criminal. I believe that the full facts have not yet come to
light," he said.
