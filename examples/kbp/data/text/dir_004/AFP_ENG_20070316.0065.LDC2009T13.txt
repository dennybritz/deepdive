Pakistan's government Friday denied it had suspended the
country's mobile telephone and Internet networks following
reports of nationwide disruption to services.


The breakdown in most Internet and mobile telephone services came
as security forces were on high alert for protests against
President Pervez Musharraf's move to sack the country's chief
justice.


"No telecommunications network has been suspended. Everything is
normal," Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durrani told AFP.


"There is no disruption of the telephone system. If there is some
congestion or some technical problem we don't know. But the
government has not disrupted any telecommunications service," he
added.


In the capital Islamabad and other cities witnesses and AFP
reporters said most mobile calls were not being put through and
many international landlines were also not functioning. Internet
services were also down.


Private television channels reported similar problems across the
country.
