Israel must boycott the incoming Palestinian unity government but
continue to work with president Mahmud Abbas to defeat Hamas,
Deputy Defence Minister Ephraim Sneh said on Friday.


"Israel cannot give legitimacy to the Palestinian unity
government by cooperating with it while it rejects the principles
of the Quartet," Sneh told Israeli public radio.


"To cause the failure of Hamas, we need a moderate Palestinian
alternative and for that purpose we must negotaite only with Abu
Mazen (Abbas)," he added.


Abbas and Palestinian prime minister designate Ismail Haniya on
Thursday finalized an agreement on a national unity government
combining their rival Fatah and Hamas factions.


The new government will be presented on Saturday to the
Palestinian parliament for approval.


Hamas will take 12 of the 25 portfolios in the incoming cabinet,
while Abbas's Fatah faction will take six. Seven ministries,
including the powerful finance, foreign and interior ministries,
will go to independents and smaller factions.


Palestinians hope the new coalition will break an international
boycott and end deadly infighting, but the unity goverment's
political program so far stops short of agreeing to meet Western
conditions for resuming aid.


They are demanding that the government renounce violence,
recognise Israel and abide by past interim peace agreements --
all conditions that Hamas has consistently refused to accept.


Israel immediately said it would not work with the new coalition,
while the United States and European Union have taken a wait-and-
see approach.
