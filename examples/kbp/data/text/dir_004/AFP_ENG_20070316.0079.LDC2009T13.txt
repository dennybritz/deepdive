Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai left hospital on
Friday in a wheelchair after being treated for head injuries
sustained at the hands of the security services, an AFP
correspondent said.


He was driven away from the private Avenues hospital in Harare
with his wife Susan, without making any comment to reporters.


The Movement for Democratic Change leader was later expected to
hold a press conference, party officials said.
