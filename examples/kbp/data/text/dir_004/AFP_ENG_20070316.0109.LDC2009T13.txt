The Israeli army said on Friday it was investigating the alleged
use by soldiers of Palestinian civilians as human shields during
a recent operation in the West Bank town of Nablus.


A statement said the army's procurator-general, Brigadier General
Avihai Mandelbit, "has ordered the military police to investigate
charges that Israeli forces broke the rules and used civilians
during an operation in Nablus two weeks ago."


In October 2005, Israel's supreme court banned the use of human
shields as being contrary to international law.


On Thursday, Channel 10 television broadcast footage shot by an
international news agency showing Israeli forces advancing behind
a young male Palestinian civilian during the door-to-door search
and arrest operation in Nablus aimed at detaining militants.


The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem charged on Thursday that
during tha Nablus operation "soldiers used two Palestinian
children (a boy aged 15 and girl of 11) and a 24-year-old man as
human shields."


B'Tselem said the soldiers were apparently "afraid that armed
fighters could be hiding in the homes or that they could have
been rigged with explosives.


"So what the two minors and the adult were forced to do posed a
clear danger and the soldiers were aware of that," it added.


The army carried out several days of searches for arms factories
and wanted militants in Nablus that ended on March 1. One
Palestinian was killed during the operation and several were
arrested.
