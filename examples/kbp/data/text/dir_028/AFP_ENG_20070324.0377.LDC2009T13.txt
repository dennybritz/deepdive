Skipper Nwankwo Kanu's second-half goal gave Nigeria full points
at the expense of visiting Uganda in a 2008 African Nations Cup
qualifying match played in Abeokuta on Saturday night.


A corner kick taken by Mikel Obi was helped on by substitute John
Utaka with goalkeeper Denis Onyango in no man's land to allow
Kanu, who was a major injury doubt leading to this clash, hook
the ball home with 15 minutes left to play.


Uganda may feel a little hard done by and even protested after a
stoppage time goal was disallowed for an infringement.


It was a winning but far from convincing start for Nigeria's
German coach Berti Vogts, who in February signed a four-year
contract.


Nigeria have now extended their lead in Group Three with nine
points from three matches. The Cranes of Uganda are on four
points.


Both teams will clash again in early June in Uganda in
continuation of the qualifying tournament for the biennial
Nations Cup to be staged in Ghana next year with the overall
group winner going through to the championship.
