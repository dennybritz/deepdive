France centre Aurelien Rougerie scored a hat-trick of tries to
help Clermont to a vital 26-29 victory over Narbonne on Saturday
and boost their bid for a top four play-off spot in the French
rugby union championship.


Leaders Stade Francais remained top of the Top 14 with a three-
point lead after Saturday's 20th round of matches, the first to
be held since the end of the Six Nations tournament.


The Parisians were left kicking themselves after giving away a
share of the points in a 19-19 draw which could so easily have
been a precious away victory until late replacement Benjamin
Boyet sent over a drop-goal for Bourgoin in the 79th minute.


Three minutes earlier Boyet, who had to sit out the Six Nations
through injury, had given the hosts a match-levelling incentive
by converting a penalty.


If not for his efforts, Stade were on their way to claiming their
first victory at the Pierre-Rajon stadium since the 2000-2001
season.


Elsewhere Toulouse stayed in the hunt, in third place, with a
convincing 28-10 win over bottom-placed Montpellier while
Perpignan missed the chance to move up a place from fourth with a
22-22 draw at championship strugglers Brive.


Bayonne picked up only their eighth win of the campaign with a
19-12 win over Castres, while Montauban claimed only their ninth
win of the season beating Agen 22-12.


Champions Biarritz had assured their re-entry to the domestic
scene with a 23-10 victory over Albi on Friday, leaving the
Basques in fifth place but still 11 points adrift of Stade.
