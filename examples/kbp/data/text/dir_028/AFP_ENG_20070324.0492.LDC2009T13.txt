Two large earthquakes struck off the coast of the tiny Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu on Sunday but were unlikely to lead to
any casualties, officials said.


Geoscience Australia said the quakes, which hit 28 minutes apart
shortly after 10:30 am (0030 GMT), were both recorded at about
the same spot, some 120 kilometres (75 miles) off the southern
tip of Vanuatu.


Seismologist Mark Leonard said the quakes, which were measured at
magnitudes of 7.3 and 7.1, were large and relatively shallow at
depths of 40 and 10 kilometres.


However, they were not considered dangerous as they were too far
out at sea.


"They are far enough out to sea to not cause any concern as to
direct earthquake damage but there may be a very small tsunami,"
he told AFP.


No tsunami warnings had been issued, or were likely to be issued,
as a result of the quakes which could generate waves of about 10
to 20 centimetres (four to eight inches), he said.


Quakes in this part of the Pacific are common but it would be
extremely unusual for two such large quakes to be followed by a
third tremor of similar size, Leonard said.


However, he added: "There's likely to be aftershocks, up to
magnitude 6.0."


Leonard said the Vanuatu quakes were completely unrelated to the
strong earthquake in Japan which led officials to issue a tsunami
warning for the west coast of the main island of Honshu.
