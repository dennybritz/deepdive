An alliance of 13 parties and groups announced Saturday that they
were uniting to set up a new "national patriotic" political
party, the Interfax agency reported.


The new party, Narodny Soyuz (Popular Union) will be built around
the existing Narodny Volya (People's Will party) headed by Sergei
Baburin, the ultranationalist deputy speaker of the Russian Duma
or lower house.


In a declaration posted on the website of Baburin's party, the
parties "recognise the role of the Russian people who created a
great power on the basis of the values of the Orthodox religion."


They attack "the crisis of Russian civilisation, the ruin of tens
of millions of citizens and the invasion of foreign ways of life
and culture."


Parliamentary elections are due in December followed by a vote in
March 2008 to elect President Vladimir Putin's successor.
