A soaring stock market triggered the launch of 90 new mutual
funds in China last year, with a total of 390 billion yuan (50
billion dollars) raised, state media reported Sunday.


"The country experienced a fund frenzy last year as retail
investors shifted low-interest bank deposits into the bourses,"
the Xinhua news agency reported from an industry forum in
Beijing.


China's stock market skyrocketed 130 percent last year, ending a
four-year slump.


China now has about 320 mutual funds, with a total of more than
one trillion yuan under management, according to Xinhua.
