Protests largely failed to materialise on Sunday morning in Hong
Kong, where the 800-strong election committee were casting their
ballots for the city's next leader.


With Beijing-backed incumbent Donald Tsang a virtual shoo-in for
another term, about 50 protesters gathered outside the polling
station, chanting: "Donald, Shame on you!"


Protesters were far outnumbered by police, and their tiny group
were confined to a spot at least one kilometre (half mile) from
the polling station's main entrance, too far away to be heard by
the voters.


What had been planned as a huge procession of vehicles driving to
the polling station -- situated far from downtown near the city's
airport -- became a small convoy of about two-dozen cars after
truck drivers refused to join in.


"We have made things uncomfortable for the election committee
members," said one of the lead protesters, Wong Yuk-man, a pro-
democracy radio talk-show host.


"This didn't happen in the last small-circle election. Donald
should feel shame. The people want democracy," Wong said.


Ordinary citizens cannot vote and the election committee, drawn
mainly from the business community, is made up mainly of pro-
Beijing figures expected to re- elect Tsang easily.


His challenger, Cambridge-educated lawmaker and barrister Alan
Leong, is part of an opposition movement advocating full
democracy. He has acknowledged he will not win but wants to
highlight the push for democracy.
