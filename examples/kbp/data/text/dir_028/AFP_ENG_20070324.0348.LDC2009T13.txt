European Union leaders reached agreement Saturday to include a
commitment to fight illegal immigration in their 50th anniversary
declaration, the German EU presidency said.


The issue was included in the two-page "Berlin Declaration" at
the demand of Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero, a spokesman for the presidency confirmed.


Spain has been particularly hard hit by clandestine immigration.
Last year more than 31,000 illegal immigrants arrived in the
Canary Islands, as well as more than 1,500 since the start of
2007.


The declaration, to be signed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
holder of the EU rotating presidency, and the European Commission
and parliament chiefs, will commit to fight terrorism, organized
crime and illegal immigration.


The declaration, marking the 50th anniversary of the EU's
founding Treaty of Rome, will be made public Sunday.
