The United States Saturday described the new UN sanctions imposed
on Iran as an international rebuke against the Islamic Republic
which would leave it even more internationally isolated.


US Undersecretary of State Nichaolas Burns told reporters the UN
Security Council resolution adopted Saturday imposing stepped-up
sanctions was an "international rebuke" and "would leave Iran
more isolated than it has been."
