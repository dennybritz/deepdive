British Prime Minister Tony Blair would have resigned if he had
been questioned as a suspect by police in the "cash for honours"
probe, The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said.


Detectives investigating the scandal wanted to interview Blair
under caution but backed off after being warned that it could
have triggered his resignation, the weekly said.


Blair's allies told police chiefs that the prime minister's
position would become untenable if he was treated as a suspect
rather than a witness, said the broadsheet on its front page.


The "cash for honours" investigation centres on allegations that
political parties, mainly Blair's governing Labour Party, offered
seats in parliament's unelected upper chamber, the House of
Lords, in return for financial assistance.


Officers wanted to question Blair under caution during the second
of two interviews conducted in December and January. They wanted
him to clarify comments he made in the first interview about an
alleged cover-up by senior aides, The Sunday Telegraph said.


"Make no mistake, Scotland Yard was informed that Mr Blair would
resign as prime minister if he was interviewed under caution," a
source told the newspaper.


"They were placed in a very difficult position."


A spokesman for Blair denied he had been "going around saying he
well resign if that happened," the broadsheet said.


"It is not true that such a message was conveyed to the police."


In a year-long probe so far, Scotland Yard have interviewed more
than 100 people and arrested four, including two senior Blair
aides: Lord Michael Levy, Labour's chief fundraiser, and Ruth
Turner, Blair's head of government relations.


Blair has pledged to step down by September and the cash-for-
honours row has been clouding his last months in office.
