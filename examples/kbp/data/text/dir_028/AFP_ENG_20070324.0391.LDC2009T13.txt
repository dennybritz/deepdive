French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy on Saturday
welcomed the new sanctions imposed on Iran by the United Nations
over its nuclear programme.


"I welcome the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1747," Douste-
Blazy said in a statement.


Fresh sanctions had been "unavoidable once the (UN nuclear
watchdog) IAEA said in its latest report that Iran was still
refusing to respect its international obligations as decided in
previous UN resolutions," he added.


"Our aim today remains more than ever to convince Iran to conform
to its international engagements," said the minister.


France is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and co-
sponsored the new resolution approved unanimously earlier on
Saturday.


"With this new resolution, the Security Council reaffirms the
clear choice facing Iran's leaders: cooperate with the
international community or continue its (uranium) enrichment
activities and thus deepen its international isolation," said
Douste-Blazy.
