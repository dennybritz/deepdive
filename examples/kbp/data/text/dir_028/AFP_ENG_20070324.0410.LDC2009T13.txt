Portugal grabbed the final qualifying spot for the 2007 Rugby
Union World Cup despite losing 18-12 to Uruguay in their second
leg play-off match here on Saturday.


The Portuguese booked their berth for the September 7 to October
20 tournament in France on superior points after winning the
first leg in Lisbon 12-5 earlier this month.


Uruguay's chances of overturning their first leg deficit were hit
after they were reduced to 14 men after just two minutes on
Saturday when second rower Juan Bado was sent off.


Portugal will play in Pool C with New Zealand, Scotland, Italy
and Romania.
