Pakistan cricket captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and caretaker coach
Mushtaq Ahmed were being requestioned on Saturday as part of the
investigation into the death of coach Bob Woolmer, the team
spokesman confirmed.


Woolmer, who died last Sunday the day after Pakistan were knocked
out of the World Cup by Ireland, was strangled to death and a
murder hunt was launched.


But spokesman PJ Mir denied that the two men were involved.


"Absolutely not, it is absolutely absurd, those two? No way. I am
not even going to think about it or even dream about it.


"There is no question that any of the players is linked at all.
It's unthinkable, I'm not even going to dream about it, let alone
think about it," said Mir.


"We have to let the police do their job and once there any
findings or anything we'll be the first to know, I'm sure."
