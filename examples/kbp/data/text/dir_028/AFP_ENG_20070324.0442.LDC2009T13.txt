France's savouring of a precious 1-0 win over Euro 2008
qualifying rivlas Lithuania was tempered by the brandishing of a
racist banner by the home fans here Saturday.


Nicolas Anelka's late strike saved France's blushes with barely
20 minutes remaining, allowing France - and their coach Raymond
Domenech -  some breathing space.


However much of the after-match talk in the dressing room centred
on a banner with racist overtones and whic appeared to be aimed
at France's black players.


According to AFP reporters the banner bore a painting of Africa
in the blue, white and red colours of France's national flag,
emblazoned with the words: "Welcome to Europe".


French football federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes did
not see the banner but said it was an "unforgivable" gesture on
the part of a section of the Lithuanian fans.


Most of the French players did not see it either, and some simply
chose to ignore it.


"Someone told me about it but I didn't see it," said French
midfielder Florent Malouda, who is from Guyana in the Caribbean.


"I was told what was on it, but I was just trying to concentrate
on my match. The important thing is that our rivals didn't share
the same opinion."


Another black player, William Gallas, added: "I don't know why
they did it. For what reason?"


Lyon midfielder Jeremy Toulalan, who is white, said: "It's just
not very intelligent. That's all I can say about it. I didn't see
it either, but we all spoke about it in the dressing room."


Football's European ruling body UEFA, which comes down hard on
violence and racism, could be forced to act in the coming days.
