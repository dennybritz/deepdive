They came in their hundreds and left in despair.


India's America-based fans were left distinctly underwhelmed by
their first World Cup experience as they watched Rahul Dravid's
team teeter towards defeat and almost certain elimination from
the tournament.


"It was terrible," said Manish who had flown in from New Jersey.


"We were pathetic... useless. I am so ashamed."


For many USA-based Indians, the World Cup in the Caribbean
represents their first chance to see their team in action.


But after years of waiting agonisingly to see the likes of
Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Souarav Ganguly and Harbajhan Singh
close-up, the fans couldn't care less if they never see them
again.


Isaac, who flew in from Washington DC, told the Trinidad Express:
"This was my one chance to see a World Cup and Tendulkar was
extremely disappointing," he said after the star Indian batsman
lasted just three balls before being dismissed for nought against
Sri Lanka.


"I am supremely disappointed."


Vinay, another guest from Washington, urged Indian supporters at
home to be more understanding of the team's plight when they
return home and preferred to applaud Sri Lanka's efforts.


"Sri Lanka was the better team," said Vinay.


"But then they did not have too much pressure on them while our
defeat (against Bangladesh) put a lot of pressure on our players.
There will be good games and bad games... unfortunately, this was
a bad game.


"We still have 2011."


Rajiv, who recently migrated from North India to New Jersey, was
dismayed by what he saw at the Queen's Park Oval.


"We were thinking we would at least reach the semi-final," he
said.


"But now we cannot even beat Bangladesh who are rookies. It was a
very bad performance for us."
