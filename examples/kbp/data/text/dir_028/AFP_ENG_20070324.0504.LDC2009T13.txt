Andre Iguodala returned to lead the Philadelphia 76ers past the
suddenly slumping Miami Heat in a National Basketball Association
contest on Saturday.


The reigning NBA champion Heat wasted a 17 point lead and fell
93-85 to the Sixers, Miami's third defeat in their past four
games. All four of those defeats have come at the hands of teams
with sub-.500 records.


Iguodala, who missed a game for the first time in his three-year
NBA career when he sat out Friday's win over Charlotte with a
lower back strain, scored 19 points as the 76ers beat the Heat
for the third time in four meetings this season.


Miami fell a game behind first-place Washington in the Southeast
Division.


Iguodala, who had played in 232 straight games before sitting
out, played 46 minutes Saturday.


The swingman shot 5-of-14 from the field, grabbed eight rebounds
and handed out six assists.


The 76ers used a 17-4 run capped by Samuel Dalembert's dunk with
8:41 remaining to grab their first lead at 72-71. Kyle Korver
scored 11 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter to seal the win.


Miami jumped out to a 30-13 lead after one quarter but failed to
score 20 points in a period thereafter as Philadelphia chipped
away at the deficit.


Jason Williams scored 21 points and Shaquille O'Neal added 18 for
the Heat, who are still without injured star Dwyane Wade.
