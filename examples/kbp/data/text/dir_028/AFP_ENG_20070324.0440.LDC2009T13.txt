One of the leaders of a tent camp the opposition staged in 2006
to defy President Alexander Lukashenko was arrested late
Saturday.


"They arrested me and are taking me to a provisionary detention
center," Vyacheslav Sivchik told AFP by telephone, adding that
"they accuse me of organising mass unrest on March 25."


Sivchik was arrested in his own apartment, he said, adding to AFP
that he intended to join demosntrations planned for Sunday.


The website of Belarus's opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich
Saturday published a list of 48 opposition activists arrested in
the past few days, including many young leaders of last year's
tent camp, in a bid to cripple Sunday's planned opposition rally.


The rally on Sunday comes a year after unprecedented protests in
the capital Minsk against presidential elections in which
authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the
overwhelming victor.
