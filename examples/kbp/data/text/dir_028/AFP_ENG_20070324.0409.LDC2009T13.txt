Pakistan cricket captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and caretaker coach
Mushtaq Ahmed were requestioned on Saturday as part of the
investigation into the death of coach Bob Woolmer.


But Inzamam insisted that the questioning was routine and that he
and Mushtaq had been told by police that they were free to leave
for home as planned later Saturday.


"It was nothing, just one question, nothing special," the 37
-year-old Inzamam said, without specifying what the police asked
of him.


"There have been so many rumours but we are going home tonight
and everything is clear. The police said we are free to go home."


Woolmer, who died last Sunday the day after Pakistan were knocked
out of the World Cup by Ireland, was strangled to death and a
murder hunt was launched.


Team spokesman PJ Mir denied that either Inzamam or Mushtaq were
involved.


"Absolutely not, it is absolutely absurd, those two? No way. I am
not even going to think about it or even dream about it.


"There is no question that any of the players is linked at all.
It's unthinkable, I'm not even going to dream about it, let alone
think about it," said Mir.


"We have to let the police do their job and once there any
findings or anything we'll be the first to know, I'm sure."
