European Union envoys are to prod Iran to reconsider its decision
to continue with sensitive nuclear activities in defiance of the
international community, a senior US official said Saturday.


EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and other EU diplomats
"would be in touch with the Iranian government in the days and
weeks ahead to see if they might reconsider their obstinate
refusal to renegotiate," US Undersecretary of State Nicholas
Burns told reporters in Washington.
