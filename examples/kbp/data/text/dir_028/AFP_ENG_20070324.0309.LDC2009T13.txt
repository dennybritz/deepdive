France's Amelie Mauresmo was named the WTA Tour 2006 Player of
the Year by the women's tennis tour, which also paid tribute to
the efforts of Martina Hingis and Jelena Jankovic among others.


In media voting announced late Friday, Mauresmo received the
award for the first time in her career after a season that saw
her win her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and
then add the Wimbledon crown as well.


Mauresmo, absent from the WTA and ATP event here due to an
appendectomy, also won in Paris and Antwerp last year and was
ranked number one for 34 weeks in a row.


Swiss star Hingis won Comeback Player of the Year honors,
returning after a three-year layoff. The former world number one
climbed to seventh in the rankings by the end of 2006 with titles
in Rome and Kolkata.


Serbian Jankovic was voted Most Improved Player, losing 10 of her
first 11 matches before rallying to end the year 44-17 with an
impressive US Open semi- final run.


American Lisa Raymond and Australian Samantha Stosur repeated as
WTA Doubles Team of the Year, the top-ranked duo's 10 titles in
2006 including a French Open crown.


Belgium's Kim Clijsters, 2005's Player of the Year, won
sportsmanship and humanitarian awards. Polish teen Agnieszka
Radwanska was named top newcomer.
