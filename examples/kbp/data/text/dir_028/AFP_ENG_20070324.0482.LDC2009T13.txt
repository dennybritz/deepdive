South Korea and the United States launched a massive joint
military exercise on Sunday that North Korea said could
jeopardise nuclear disarmament talks.


"As scheduled, the annual exercise involving US and South Korean
troops started today across South Korea," a defence ministry
official told AFP.


The RSOI (Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration)
and Foal Eagle exercise focuses on a mock battle aimed at
preparing for the sudden arrival of US reinforcements, US
officials said earlier.


It also featurs anti-commando operations and computer war games.


As part of the exercise, the USS Ronald Reagan plus a cruiser and
two destroyers have joined tens of thousands of US and South
Korean soldiers.


The allies say the exercise is purely defensive in nature and
have rejected North Korean claims it is in preparation for an
invasion.


North Korea has accused Washington of carrying out the exercise
while negotiations have been under way with Pyongyang as part of
six-nation talks over the North's nuclear programmes.


The United States has stationed tens of thousands of troops in
the South since the Korean war began in June 1950 with an
invasion by the North.


Currently some 29,500 US troops are stationed here to help
680,000 South Korean forces face up to North Korea's 1.1-million-
strong military.
