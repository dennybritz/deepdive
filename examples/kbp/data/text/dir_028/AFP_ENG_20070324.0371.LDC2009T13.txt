Top seed Maria Sharapova made a triumphant start at the WTA and
ATP Masters Series hardcourt event here Saturday by defeating
Taiwan's Yung-Jan Chan 6-3, 6-2 in a second-round match.


The Russian star, who received a first-round bye, was last year's
runner-up at this 6.9 milion-dollar event, losing to compatriot
Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4, 6-3 in the final.


Sharapova, who had not played since a fourth-round loss to Vera
Zvonareva at Indian Wells 11 days earlier, might have to defeat
eighth-seeded compatriot Nicole Vaidisova and US 13th seed Serena
Williams to reach the semi-finals.


Williams blasted Sharapova in January's Australian Open women's
final.


Swiss world number one and men's top seed Roger Federer was set
to begin his title defense later Saturday against US wild card
Sam Querrey with hopes of doing better than his first-match exit
from Indian Wells.


The match will be the first for Federer since his 41-match
winning streak was snapped by Guillermo Canas of Argentina on
March 11 at Indian Wells.


Canas, a qualifier here, could face Federer again in the round of
16.
