Mexico's Lorena Ochoa fired a 3-under 69 here Saturday to take a
four-shot lead into the final round of the 1.5 million-dollar
LPGA Safeway International.


The 25-year-old 2006 Player of the Year had a 54-hole total of
14-under 202, and was four strokes in front of South Korean Jeong
Jang (68) and Norway's Suzann Pettersen (69).


After two days of stormy weather, Ochoa returned from an
overnight suspension to complete four holes of a second-round 64
- the lowest round of the tournament - on Saturday morning.


While she couldn't find the same form on the greens in the
aftgernoon, she did make birdies at the first, fourth and 18th
holes in a bogey-free third round.


"It has been a long day but a really good one," Ochoa said. "I
set up a lot of chances this afternoon but couldn't make many
putts. Hopefully, they will all fall tomorrow."


Britain's Catriona Matthew, who was second after the second
round, slipped into a tie for fifth after an erratic 2-over 74
that included a three-putt bogey at the last hole.


World No. 1 Annika Sorenstam birdied the final two holes for a 69
and was alongside Matthew, eight strokes behind Ochoa.
