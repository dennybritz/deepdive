Two policemen and eight members of Darfur's former rebel Sudanese
Liberation Movement (SLM) were killed on Saturday in a shootout
near the capital, the interior minister told reporters.


Interior Minister Zubeir Beshir Taha told a televised press
conference that police had reported losing two men in the battle,
including a lieutenant colonel, while the SLM said it had eight
dead and six wounded.


He added that the clashes began when a civilian opened fire on a
group of SLM members in a residential neighbourhood of Khartoum's
twin city of Omdurman.


The situation was now under control, he added.


The SLM of Minni Minnawi launched a revolt against the central
government in Sudan's western Darfur region in 2003, but three
years later signed a peace accord with the government.
