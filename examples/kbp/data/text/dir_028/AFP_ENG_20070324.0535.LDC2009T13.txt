Chinese President Hu Jintao has hailed a new law protecting
private property as a boon to the legal system, state media said
Sunday, in the highest-level endorsement yet of the controversial
legislation.


"It is an important step forward for the formation of a socialist
legal system with Chinese characteristics," Hu was quoted as
telling members of the Communist Party elite, according to the
People's Daily.


"It is a significant move towards implementing the basic strategy
of governing the country according to law," the president and
Communist Party leader said.


Hu told officials to take the lead in studying the law and to
ensure its implementation would help create "a more fair and open
market order."


The article was the main front-page item in the Communist Party
mouthpiece, signalling the priority that the leadership attaches
to promoting the law and, possibly, silencing its critics.


The Property Law, which guarantees protection for the state-
owned, the collective and the private sectors, triggered
unprecedented debate before being passed by the legislature
earlier this month.


It went through a record 13 years of debate, passed seven
readings and had been the subject of criticism and proposals from
47 government departments and 11,500 members of the public.


Old-school Marxists have been its most fierce opponents, arguing
the law is a sell-out pushing China dangerously close to
capitalism.
