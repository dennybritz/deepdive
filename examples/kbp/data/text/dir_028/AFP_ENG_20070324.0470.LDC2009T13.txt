An attorney for a victim of Uruguay's 1973-1985 dictatorship has
asked his government to request the extradition of former US
secretary of state Henry Kissinger over his alleged role in the
notorious Operation Condor.


Condor was a secret plan hatched by South American dictators in
the 1970s to eliminate leftist political opponents in the region.
Details of the plan have emerged over the past years in documents
and court testimony.


The Latin American dictatorships of the time "were mere
executors" of a "plan of extermination" hatched in the United
States by a group led by Kissinger, said attorney Gustavo Salle,
who represents the family of Bernardo Arnone.


Uruguayan prosecutor Mirtha Guianze has received the request and
is studying the case, according to news reports.


A leftist activist, Arnone was arrested in October 1976 and flown
to Argentina with a group of political prisoners that vanished
and were presumably executed.


Kissinger played a dominant role in US foreign policy between
1969 and 1977, and was a strong supporter of right-wing regimes
across Latin America.


The extradition request comes as the topic of rights violations
during Uruguay's dictatorship is making headlines again, with
Salle citing evidence from declassified US State Department
documents.


Witnesses are set to testify in April in a case that began in
September against eight retired regime officials over rights
violations.
