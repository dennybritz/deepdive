Pakistan's cricket team, shaken by the strangling of their coach
following a shock loss in the World Cup, left Jamaica late
Saturday for London.


The team was whisked through Montego Bay's airport guarded by
Jamaican police after several key members underwent a second
round of questioning in the investigation of the murder of coach
Bob Woolmer, who died one week ago after being found unconscious
in his Kingston hotel room.


Among those interviewed a second time was team captain Inzamam
ul-Haq and assistant coach Mustaq Ahmed. Police emphasized that
neither were suspects.


"Everybody is on the bus," team spokesman Pervez Mir told
reporters at the airport. He later added that the team did not
expect "anyone to be called back here."


The team flew to London with a stopover in Kingston.


Asked about the team's mood, Mir said that "lots of anxiety, lots
of pressure had built up in the side," but that they were dealing
well with the tragedy.


Woolmer was murdered March 18 just one day after minnow Ireland
shocked the cricket world by defeating powerhouse Pakistan,
effectively ending the World Cup appearance for the former world
champions.


Police have said they have not arrested any suspects, fueling
speculation that the murder may have involved match-rigging
syndicates.
