Hong Kong's China-backed leader Donald Tsang won a new term as
chief executive on Sunday as expected, when the city's 800-strong
election committee re-elected him easily, officials said.


Tsang defeated challenger Alan Leong by a vote of 649-123, they
said.


Sunday's poll marked the first time since Britain handed Hong
Kong back to China in 1997 that the race for leader was
contested.


The members of Hong Kong's election committee are the only people
in this territory of nearly seven million people allowed to vote
for the chief executive.
