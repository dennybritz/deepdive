Hamas militants fired at members of Palestinian president Mahmud
Abbas's Fatah movement in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, injuring
four, medical sources and security officials said.


Hamas gunmen opened fire on the Fatah members at Khan Yunis as
they attempted to stop a fifth member being kidnapped by the
Islamist group.


The two groups have just formed a national unity government after
nearly a year of power struggles.


A sixth Fatah member was injured after being shot by masked men
in the Maghazi refugee camp, the sources said.


The new government was formed after an agreement was reached on
February 8 in Mecca between Abbas and Hamas political chief
Khaled Meshaal to end factional clashes in which dozens of
Palestinians were killed.


But clashes and kidnappings began again on Thursday with a four-
year old boy killed in clashes in the northern Gaza Strip on
Friday and the corpse of a Fatah activist kidnapped earlier in
the day turning up in Gaza City.
