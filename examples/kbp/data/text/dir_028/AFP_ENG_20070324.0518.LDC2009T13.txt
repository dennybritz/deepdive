The police chief heading the investigation into the murder of
Pakistan cricket coach Bob Woolmer told a British Sunday
newspaper that the odds on Ireland beating Pakistan would be
probed.


In a shock result, minnows Ireland beat Pakistan by three wickets
in the 2007 World Cup Group D match on March 17.


The following day, Woolmer was discovered strangled to death in
his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica.


Mark Shields, Jamaica's deputy commissioner of police, raised
suspicions over generous odds of eight to one being touted for an
Irish win in the hours before the Pakistan match, The Observer
reported.


Rumours have swirled that the strangling murder of the 58-year-
old former England international may be linked to match-fixing
gangs suspecting he was soon to blow the whistle on corrupt
practices.


Shields told The Observer: "One aspect is what were the odds on
Ireland if Ireland won. I understand that they were extremely
good if you bet on Ireland. The match-fixing thing is being
looked at."


Reeling from Woolmer's murder, Pakistan's cricketers headed home
Saturday after police interviewed three team members for a second
time, but said none of them were suspects.


"They clarified a number points," Shields said after captain
Inzamam-ul-Haq, caretaker coach Mushtaq Ahmed and manager Talat
Ali were questioned just before they and the rest of the team
flew out of Jamaica.
