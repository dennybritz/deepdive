Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on Saturday dismissed
the UN sanctions adopted by the Security Council against Iran as
"unlawful" and "unjustifiable actions" by a few of its members.


He said the sanctions unanimously adopted by the 15 members
marked "the fourth time in the last 12 months that in a
unwarranted move orchestrated by a few of its permanent members,
the Security Council is being abused to take an unlawful,
unnceccesary and unjustifiable action against the peaceful
nuclear program of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
