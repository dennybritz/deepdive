Detroit defenseman Brett Lebda suffered a concussion here
Saturday when hit from behind, hurting the Red Wings as they
fight for a National Hockey League home- ice playoff advantage.


The American was hurt 6 1/2 minutes into the first period against
St. Louis and taken from the ice in a neck brace on a stretcher
after being slammed to the ice in a corner by Blues left wing
Ville Nieminen.


Doctors at Detroit Medical Center determined Lebda had suffered a
concussion when hit by Nieminen, who was given a five-minute
major for boarding and a game misconduct on the play.


Second-year NHLer Lebda has four goals, 11 assists and 57 penalty
minutes in 70 games this season.


The Red Wings, who clinched a playoff berth Friday when Colorado
lost to Edmonton, has 45 triumphs and 100 points this season,
level with Anaheim one point behind Western Conference leader
Nashville.
