Three members of Pakistan's cricket team were questioned for a
second time Saturday in the brutal murder of their coach Bob
Woolmer, but Jamaican police said they were not suspects.


"They clarified a number points," Jamaica's deputy commissioner
of police Mark Shields said after Captain Inzamam-ul-Haq,
caretaker coach Mushtaq Ahmed and manager Talat Ali were
questioned just before they and the rest of the team headed to
the Montego Bay airport for their flight home.


"There is nothing to suggest any of them is a suspect at this
stage," Shields said at a news conference in Kingston, after
briefing two officials from the Pakistani embassy in Washington
who flew in on Saturday.


"It was nothing, just one question, nothing special," the 37
-year-old Inzamam told Sky News television.


All members of the team already had been interviewed by police
and gave DNA samples and fingerprints. Woolmer said they had
cooperated fully.


"They were never under detention," said Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri,
the first secretary at the Pakistani embassy in Washington.


But he said the team was still "traumatized" by the strangling
death of their coach in his Kingston hotel room on Sunday, one
day after the team was pushed out of the World Cup tournament in
a shock loss to Ireland.


The diplomat said Pakistan was "very satisfied with the
performance of Jamaican police" dealing with the investigation.
