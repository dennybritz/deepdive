Lawyers for 14 Tunisians on trial on terrorism charges called on
Saturday for their immediate release and for medical checks to
establish whether they were tortured.


The accused, aged between 20 and 25, are accused of having links
to Algeria's Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC),
which announced in September it was linking up with Al-Qaeda.


They are charged with belonging to a terrorist organisation,
recruiting for jihad or holy war, fundraising, planning terrorist
attacks and with weapons training.


Seven of them were arrested in Algeria before being handed over
to Tunisian authorities in April 2005, while the others are
accused of planning to travel to Algeria to prepare for jihad,
their lawyers say.


Some of them have admitted going to Algeria for military training
but say this was to carry out jihad in Iraq and have denied
charges of terrorism.


Laywers Samir Ben Amor and Radia Nasraoui claim that those
arrested in Algeria were tortured twice -- once in Algeria and
again in Tunisia -- and have demanded medical reports.


Another laywer, Raouf Ayadi, attacked what he called "a wave of
political trials carried out under the pretext of a preventative
war against terrorism imposed on the world by the United States
of America."


A verdict is due by Monday.
