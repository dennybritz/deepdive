The Security Council voted unanimously Saturday to slap new UN
sanctions on Iran in a bid to pressure it into freezing its
uranium enrichment program.


The council's 15 members adopted Resolution 1747, co-sponsored by
Britain, France and Germany, that broadens UN sanctions imposed
on Iran in December for spurning repeated demands to suspend
sensitive nuclear fuel work.
