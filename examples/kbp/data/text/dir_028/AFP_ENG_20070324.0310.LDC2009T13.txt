Hundreds protested in the Polish capital Saturday against the
country's military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well
as the installation of a US anti- missile shield.


Protesters gathered before the presidential palace in Warsaw's
center in a demonstration organised by left-wing organisations.


Referring to President Lech Kaczynski -- or possibly his twin
brother, Prime Minister Jaroslav Kaczynski -- protesters yelled
"Kaczynski -- terrorist!"


They also threw small plastic ducks toward the palace. The
president's name in Polish is a derivative of the word duck.


Poland is a close ally of the United States. It currently has 900
soldiers deployed in Iraq.


Twenty-four Polish nationals have been killed since the start of
the war.


Poland is in the process of increasing its forces in Afghanistan
and is expected to have nearly 1,200 troops deployed there by the
end of May.


The Polish government is also in negotiations with the United
States on the installation of interceptor missiles. They would be
part of a wider anti-missile shield being developed by the
Americans.


Parts of the shield are already in place in the United States,
Britain and Greenland, and the US plan is to have the system
fully operational by 2011-2012. The installation of a radar in
the Czech Republic is also being negotiated.


A recent poll from the GfK Institute shows that 51 percent of the
Polish are against the installation of the anti-missile shield in
their country, while 30 percent are in favor.
