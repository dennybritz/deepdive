Two men have been killed in shooting attacks in Thailand's
Muslim-majority south, where a separatist insurgency has raged
for three years, police said Sunday.


A 44-year-old man who was an aide to a local Islamic religious
leader was shot dead late Saturday in Pattani, one of three
provinces along the Malaysian border hit by the unrest, police
said.


Another Muslim man was killed in a separate shooting late
Saturday in Pattani, police added.


More than 2,000 people have been killed since the insurgency
erupted three years ago.


The attacks have recently increased in frequency and brutality
despite a number of peace-building measures proposed by the new
government, which was installed after a coup last year.


Although experts say the militancy shows a growing influence from
Islamic extremism, Muslims who are perceived as sympathetic to
the government are often victims of the violence.
