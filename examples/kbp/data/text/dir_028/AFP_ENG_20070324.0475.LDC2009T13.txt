Japan issued a tsunami warning Sunday along the west coast of the
main island of Honshu following a strong earthquake, the
meteorological agency said.


The 7.1-magnitude quake occurred at around 9:42 am (0042 GMT) in
Ishikawa prefecture, about 300 kilometres (200 miles) northwest
of the capital Tokyo, the agency said. There were no immediate
reports of casualties.


The tsunami warning was issued for the coast of the Noto
peninsula facing the Sea of Japan (East Sea), the agency said,
urging residents to head to higher ground.


The first wave measuring 10 centimetres (four inches) hit the
coast about 20 minutes after the quake, national broadcaster NHK
reported, but meteorologists warned that waves of up to 50
centimetres could be seen.


In the city of Nanao on the peninsula, officials said they had
received reports of a fire and a ruptured water main, but no
reports of casualties, Jiji Press said.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes, which
frequently jolt Tokyo and other major cities.


The country prides itself on having one of the world's most
accurate systems for assessing earthquakes and predicting
tsunamis.
