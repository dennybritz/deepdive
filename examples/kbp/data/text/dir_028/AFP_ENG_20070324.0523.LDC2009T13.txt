Energy-hungry China has started drilling what it says will be
Asia's deepest oil and gas well, state media said Sunday.


State-owned Sinopec plans for the Chuanke No. 1 Well in southwest
Sichuan province to reach a depth of 8,875 metres (30,000 feet)
-- more than the height of Mount Everest, Xinhua news agency
reported.


It will take the company, Asia's largest oil refiner, 676 days
and 300 million yuan (39 million dollars) to complete the
project, according to Xinhua.


But if the past is any guide, the work could eventually be in
vain.


In July 2006, China completed drilling of the 8,408-meter Tashen
No. 1 Well, in the Tahe oil field in northwest China's Tarim
Basin -- but discovered no gas.


With existing oil fields drying up each year, China has been
increasingly keen to find energy and resources both at home and
abroad to fuel what has grown into the world's fourth largest
economy.
