The UN Security Council's five permanent members and Germany said
Saturday they were committed to negotiating an end to the row
over Iran's nuclear program, after the UN slapped fresh sanctions
on Tehran.


"We are committed to seeking a negotiated solution that would
address the international community's concerns," the foreign
ministers of China, France, Russia, Britain, the United States
and Germany said in a statement released by the Unite States
here.
