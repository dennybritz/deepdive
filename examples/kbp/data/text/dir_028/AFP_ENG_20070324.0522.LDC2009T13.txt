Germany's Britta Kamrau-Corestein won the women's 25km open water
world title Sunday with a gritty solo swim to beat America's
Kalyn Keller and Russia's Ksenia Popova.


Kamrau-Corestein had a lead of four minutes when the race was
suspended at the halfway point due to strong winds and big waves
on Saturday and she held on when it restarted Sunday.


The German was able to keep her distance from a chasing pack of
four swimmers throughout almost three hours of racing to win by
two minutes and 27 seconds.
