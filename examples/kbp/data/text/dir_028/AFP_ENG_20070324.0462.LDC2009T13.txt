The 800 members of Hong Kong's mostly pro-Beijing election
committee voted Sunday for the city's next leader, with current
China-backed chief executive Donald Tsang virtually assured of
victory.


The poll marks the first time since Britain handed Hong Kong back
to China in 1997 that a challenger is running in the leadership
contest -- pro-democracy lawmaker Alan Leong.


But the overwhelming majority of the election committee have said
they will back Tsang.


Voting, which opened in the morning at a convention centre near
the city's airport, was to last two hours, with results expected
as early as midday.


The 800 election committee members are the only people in this
city of nearly seven million who can vote for chief executive.


The 62-year-old Tsang, a career civil servant, said during the
campaign that he had secured the support of 641 electors.


Under the terms of the 1997 handover, China agreed to a Basic Law
that calls universal suffrage the "ultimate aim" in selecting the
city's leader.


Since then, however, Hong Kong residents have only been allowed
to vote for some of the election committee, and even the
committee's decision can be overturned by the Beijing government.
