Ten people died when flames broke out in a ground-floor night
club in downtown Moscow, engulfing all in smoke, officials said
early Sunday.


"As a result of the fire, 10 people, including a Bulgarian
national, died, and we are working at their identification," the
city's deputy prosecutor Vladimir Poneversky said as quoted by
the RIA Novosti news agency.


"According to preliminary information, the fire started near the
bar, with strong smoke starting shortly afterwards, and people
died on the spot, poisoned with carbon monoxide," Poneversky
said.


Moscow prosecutors launched an investigation on suspicion of poor
fire security in the night club, he added.
