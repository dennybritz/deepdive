Leading European tourism company TUI plans to cut jobs at its
headquarters in Germany, the company's CEO said in a newspaper
interview to be published Sunday.


"There will be cuts. Structural costs at our headquarters are not
bearable," Michael Frenzel told German weekly Welt am Sonntag.


He said the number of job cuts had not been decided. There are
450 employees at the company's headquarters.


"We are still in the process of calculating it," he said.


TUI is planning to merge its tourism division with British
company First Choice. TUI will own 51 percent of the new company,
to be based in Britain and called TUI Travel.
