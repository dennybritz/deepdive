Turkish foreign ministry officials confirmed Monday that EU
foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Iran's nuclear negotiator
Ali Larijani will meet in Turkey on Wednesday, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency reported.


The exact venue of the talks is not yet known, an unnamed source
told Anatolia.


Solana said earlier in Luxembourg that the meeting would be held
in Ankara.


Anatolia quoted officials as saying Iranian Foreign Minister
Manouchehr Mottaki told his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul
during talks here last Tuesday that Tehran would be "pleased if
Turkey helps" find a diplomatic solution to its nuclear standoff
with the West.


Solana and Larijani held several rounds of talks last year and
again on the sidelines of the Munich security conference on
February 11, but failed to find a solution.


Wednesday's meeting will coincide with the midpoint of a 60-day
UN deadline for Iran to cease its uranium enrichment activities,
which Iran has flatly refused to do despite the threat of further
Security Council sanctions.
