Sudanese government forces will refrain from carrying out
military operations in strife-torn Darfur for two months, a top
official said Monday.


"The government forces will not conduct military operations in
Darfur for the next two months," Presidential Adviser Majzub al-
Khalifa Ahmed said.


He said that period should be used by rebel groups that did not
endorse a May 2006 peace agreement to join the negotiations aimed
at ending the four-year-old civil conflict and "catch up with the
peace march".


Khalifa was speaking at a ceremony marking the launch of the
Darfur Transitional Regional Authority, a body created as part of
the implementation of the moribund peace deal.
