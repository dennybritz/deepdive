Russian police killed two militants holed up in a village in the
turbulent North Caucasus province of Dagestan during a gun battle
on Monday, an interior ministry official said.


"Two militants were killed. An assault rifle and two pistols, as
well as hand grenades, were found in the house," the local
ministry official told AFP by telephone.


Dagestan is a restive Muslim province on Russia's Caspian Sea
shoreline that neighbours war-ravaged Chechnya and is frequently
the scene of attacks by militant groups.


Special police units acting on a tip-off surrounded a group of
militants in a residential home in the village of Pervomayskoye,
said the official, who requested anonymity.


"The militants were given the possibility to surrender.... They
fired on the police. We took the decision to destroy them. The
gun battle went on for several hours," he said.


The official said that a police officer was slightly injured in
the operation.
