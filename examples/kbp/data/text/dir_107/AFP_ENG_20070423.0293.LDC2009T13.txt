Major Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Works said
Monday it has bought 80 percent of Anchor Electricals of India in
hopes of a slice of the booming market.


The purchase will allow the Japanese company to make a fully-
fledged entry into the Indian electrical construction materials
sector, such as lighting fixtures, Matsushita Electric Works
said.


The company, which markets the National brand of appliances, paid
some 50 billion yen (421.6 million dollars) for the stake.


It is part of Matsushita Electric Industrial, the global firm
known for the Panasonic brand.


"The business expansion in the Indian market has been a top
priority in order to attain the top market share in the entire
Asian region," the company said in a statement.


The rapidly-growing Indian market is particularly promising as
the government has promoted improvements of infrastructure,
Matsushita said.


The firm holds an overwhelming market share in the wiring devices
market in Japan and has been active in China, Taiwan, South Korea
and Southeast Asia.
