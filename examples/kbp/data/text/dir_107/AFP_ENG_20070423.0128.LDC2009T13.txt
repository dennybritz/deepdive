An Olympic Airlines plane made an emergency landing in Munich,
Germany, following a bomb alert, the airline said on Monday.


An unknown caller contacted police in Athens claiming there was a
bomb on the Olympic flight from Athens to Brussels via
Strasbourg, carrying 134 passengers, an airline spokeswoman told
AFP.


The Greek airline ordered the pilot to land in Munich where the
plane was being examined, she said.


The flight left Athens at 9:30 am (0630 GMT) and the bomb threat
came about 40 minutes later, just as the aircraft was flying over
Split, Croatia.
