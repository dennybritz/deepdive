Human Rights Watch said Monday it would keep open its office in
Uzbekistan after the authorities reversed an earlier decision to
withdraw accreditation from the rights group's representative.


The US-based watchdog's representative, Andrea Berg, said the
authorities had renewed her accreditation on a three-month trial
basis.


The earlier decision withdrawing her accreditation, which would
have effectively shut the organization out of Uzbekistan, came as
the European Union is due to consider whether to lift sanctions
it has imposed on the country.
