An Iranian man convicted of murder has been hanged in a prison in
northwestern East Azarbaijan province, the official IRNA news
agency reported on Monday.


The man identified as Firouz A., was hanged on Monday morning in
the town of Ahar for murdering a woman in 2002, IRNA said.


The hangings bring to at least 47 the number of executions in
Iran this year. At least 154 people were executed in 2006,
according to an AFP tally based on press and witness reports.


Capital offences in the Islamic republic include murder, rape,
armed robbery, apostasy, blasphemy, serious drug trafficking,
repeated sodomy, adultery or prostitution, treason and espionage.
