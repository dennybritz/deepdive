Russian cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, 80, has been
hospitalised after falling seriously ill, RIA Novosti news agency
quoted a source close to the legendary musician as saying Monday.


"Last week (he) was again transferred from a sanatorium to a
hospital because he is in a serious condition," the source at a
Moscow opera school founded by Rostropovich's wife, Galina
Vishnevskaya, said.


RIA Novosti also quoted the secretary of the Rostropovich
Foundation confirming the report.


Earlier this month Rostropovich was hospitalised at Moscow's
Blokhin cancer institute for a routine procedure, his
spokeswoman, Nataliya Dollezhal, told AFP Monday. She would not
comment on the report of the latest hospitalisation.
