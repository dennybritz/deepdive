North Korea's deputy foreign minister has arrived in Indonesia to
brief top government officials on progress over its  nuclear
disarmament, a foreign ministry spokesman said Monday.


Deputy foreign minister Kim Young-Il will hold talks Tuesday with
the Indonesian foreign ministry's director general of Asia
Pacific affairs, the spokesman said.


"He will update the Indonesian government over the development of
six-party talks held in Beijing over its nuclear weapons program
as well as over the technical obstacles on the issue," spokesman
Kristianto Legowo told AFP.


He said Indonesia welcomed the visit adding the government
supported a peaceful solution of the crisis.


North Korea missed an April 14 deadline to shut down its nuclear
reactor under an international accord. It says it will only do so
once it receives 25 million dollars which had been frozen in a
Macau bank at US instigation.


Six-party talks involve the two Koreas, China, Japan, the United
States and Russia.


Officials from Indonesia and North Korea will also hold bilateral
talks during the minister's three-day visit, the spokesman said.


"We will also discuss some bilateral issues during Tuesday's
meeting," he said without giving further details.


Jakarta has long-standing ties with Pyongyang, dating from the
era of Indonesia's first president Sukarno. South Korea and
Indonesia established diplomatic ties in 1973.
