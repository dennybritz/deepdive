European countries made strides last year in cleaning up their
public finances, with deficit levels down sharply from the
previous year, according to official EU figures published Monday.


The average deficit level in the eurozone as a percentage of
gross domestic output (GDP) fell last year to 1.6 percent from
2.5 percent in 2005, the Eurostat data agency said.


A Eurostat official said that "at least half" of the drop was due
to a sharp improvement in German finances, where the deficit fell
to 1.7 percent in 2006 from 3.2 percent in 2005.


As Europe's biggest economy enjoyed its strongest growth in six
years in 2006, more tax revenues than expected flooded into state
coffers, helping the government cut the deficit.


Deficits were also down across the European Union, with the
average falling to 1.7 percent last year from 2.4 percent in
2005.


Under EU rules, member states are supposed to keep their deficits
to less than three percent of GDP, although only the 13 countries
sharing the euro face the threat of fines if they consistently
breach the limit.


While deficits were sharply lower, European countries were less
successful in reducing debt, which is in effect the accumulation
of money owed to pay for past deficits.


The eurozone's average debt level eased to 69.0 percent of GDP
last year from 70.5 percent while in the EU the average slipped
to 61.7 percent from 62.9 percent.
