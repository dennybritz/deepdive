Palestinian militants fired a rocket into southern Israel on
Monday in a fresh truce violation but causing no damage or
casualties, an army spokeswoman said.


The projectile slammed into a field and radical Palestinian
faction Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for firing a rocket
in a statement published in Gaza.


Witnesses in northern Gaza had said earlier that Israeli
helicopters dropped fliers threatening an incursion unless rocket
fire stops within 48 hours.


The Israeli army spokeswoman, however, denied that any leaflets
were dropped over the Palestinian coastal territory on Monday.


One Gaza militant was killed in an Israeli air strike on Saturday
after a rocket attack lightly wounded two Israelis in the
southern town of Sderot.


Another eight Palestinians, including two teenagers, were killed
by troops in the occupied West Bank on Saturday and Sunday -- the
bloodiest such weekend since the November 26 truce came into
effect in the Gaza Strip.


Under the ceasefire, Israeli troops withdrew from the territory
and Palestinian militants were to stop firing rockets into
Israel. Despite violations by both sides, the truce has largely
held.
