An official from Taiwan denied Monday that the country had struck
an agreement with rival China to host a leg of the Olympic torch
relay.


"This is not true. Discussions are still going on," Liu Teh-hsun,
the deputy chairman of Taiwan's policy making body on Chinese
matters, the Mainland Affairs Council, told AFP.


An official for the 2008 Beijing Games had earlier said that both
sides had agreed the torch relay could go through Taiwan, with
full details yet to be worked out.


"Taiwan has agreed Taiwan will be included on the Olympic torch
relay," Wang Wei, the vice president of the Beijing Games
organising committee, had told reporters in China.


Taipei's major concern was whether the event would be used to
promote China's assertion that Taiwan is part of its territory,
Liu said.


"We have made it clear that Taiwan's title and status should be
fully respected if the torch relay is to be held here," he said.


Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian from the ruling, independence-
leaning Democratic Progressive Party has categorically rejected
Beijing's territorial claim on the island.


China has repeatedly threatened to invade Taiwan should it
declare formal independence.
