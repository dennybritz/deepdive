Umaru Yar'Adua of Nigeria's ruling party was declared winner
Monday of the presidential elections by the country's electoral
commission.


"Umaru Yar'Adua is hereby declared the winner," the president of
the commission, Maurice Iwu, said.


Yar'Adua won with 24.6 million votes, far ahead of his two main
opposition rivals.


The 55-year-old governor of the northern state of Katsina, was
the candidate of President Olusegun Obasanjo's ruling People's
Ruling Party (PDP) and consequently was favoured to win.


He takes over from Obasanjo at the end of May in the first
civilian-to-civilian transition in Nigeria's turbulent history
since independence in 1960.


As a former military ruler, Obasanjo handed power over to
civilians in 1979.


Two decades later, after 15 years of almost-constant military
rule, he went on to win two successive presidential elections in
1999 and 2003, marred by allegations of massive vote rigging.
