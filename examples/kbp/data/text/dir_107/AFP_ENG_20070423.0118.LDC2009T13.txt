At least two people were killed and four wounded Monday when
rival Somali clan members clashed in the southern port of Kismayo
over car theft, a police official and witness said.


The fighting erupted after Marehan clan gunmen attacked their
rivals from the Majerteen clan whom they suspected of stealing a
car from a Marehan police officer in Kismayo, about 500
kilometres (310 miles) south of Mogadishu.


"The fighting between the clans started after a dispute over a
car robbery incident. I have seen two people killed and four
wounded," said Abdi Aden Mohamed, a resident of Kismayo.


Mohamed Hassan, a police officer, confirmed the fighting.


Inter-clan fighting is common in Somalia since the 1991 ouster of
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre touched off a deadly power struggle
that has defied numerous attempts to restore stability in the
country.


More than 200 civilians have been killed in the capital in six
days of clashes between Ethiopian forces and Islamist insurgents,
who are opposed to the presence of the foreign troops in the
country.
