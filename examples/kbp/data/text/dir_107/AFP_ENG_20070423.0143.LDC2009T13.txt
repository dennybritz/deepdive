French President Jacques Chirac had a meeting with the right-wing
presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday and pledged his
continued support ahead of the decisive second-round of the
election, Chirac's office said.


"The president of the Republic received Nicolas Sarkozy this
morning. He warmly congratulated him on the results of the first
round and passed on his encouragement and support for the second
round of the presidential election," a spokesman said.


Sarkozy came first in Sunday's multi-candidate phase of the
election, ahead of Socialist Segolene Royal who qualifies with
him for the run-off on May 6.


Chirac, who has had difficult relations with Sarkozy in the past,
endorsed his candidacy on March 21.
