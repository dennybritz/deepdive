The leader of the Swedish Liberal Party, a junior member of the
centre-right coalition government, will step down in September
following harsh criticism of his leadership, the party said on
Monday.


"Liberal Party leader Lars Leijonborg has today informed the head
of the party's election committee that he will not be running for
re-election as party leader at the Liberal Party congress in
September," the party said in a statement.


Leijonborg is also education minister in the four-party coalition
government, in power since October, but it was not immediately
known whether he would retain his cabinet post after his
resignation from the party leadership.


Criticism about Leijonborg's lacklustre leadership has escalated
in recent weeks, with various districts saying they would not
support his re-election.


The party won 7.5 percent of votes in Sweden's September 2006
legislative election, down from 13.4 percent in the 2002
election.


The Liberals have also been embroiled in a damaging Watergate-
like scandal that erupted just prior to the election.


The party's youth wing was found to have hacked into the then-
ruling Social Democrats' computer network 78 times between
January and March to obtain information about the party's
election strategy.


The case went before a Stockholm court last week.
