Eight miners are missing in northern China after their coal mine
flooded early Monday, state media reported, in the latest in a
spate of recent disasters that have left nearly 100 people dead
or missing.


The mine near the city of Linfen, a major coal-producing region
in Shanxi province, was operating with expired safety
credentials, Xinhua news agency said.


The report gave no details as to how the mine flooded.


Meanwhile, eight other miners were feared killed in a mine
explosion in central Hunan province on Sunday. That mine had been
operating illegally and its owner fled following the disaster,
Xinhua reported.


The two incidents follow a horrific last week for China's
notoriously dangerous coal mining industry, in which more than 80
miners were killed or are still missing in several accidents
across the country.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with more than 4,700 workers killed last year, according
to official figures. Independent labour groups put the death toll
at up to 20,000 annually.
