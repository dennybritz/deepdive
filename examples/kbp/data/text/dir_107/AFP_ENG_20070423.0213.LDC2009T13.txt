Six Afghan intelligence agents and two policemen were killed in
remote- controlled bomb blasts in Afghanistan Monday in fresh
attacks linked to a growing Taliban insurgency.


The six were killed in the eastern province of Laghman where a
similar blast on Sunday killed two other intelligence agents, a
bodyguard and a driver. The province is about 120 kilometres (75
miles) from Kabul, the capital.


"Six intelligence officers were killed in the blast and another
four were wounded," provincial police chief General Asil
Totakhail told AFP.


Totakhail blamed the attack on the "enemies of Afghanistan," a
term used by Afghan authorities to refer to fighters for the
Taliban movement that was driven from government in 2001.


Hours earlier a roadside bomb struck a police patrol in the
southeastern province of Zabul, killing two policemen and
wounding five, said Mohammad Wazir, chief of the district of
Shamulzayi on the border with Pakistan.


A spokesman for the Taliban said the extremist movement had
carried out the attack.


The Afghan security forces have been the target of scores of
bombings in the past months, with the Taliban insurgency relying
heavily on roadside blasts and suicide attacks in their campaign
against the Western-backed government.


Around 150 members of the forces have been killed in attacks this
year, which promises to be as violent as 2006.


Well over 4,000 people were killed in insurgency-linked unrest
last year, more than four times the 2005 toll.
