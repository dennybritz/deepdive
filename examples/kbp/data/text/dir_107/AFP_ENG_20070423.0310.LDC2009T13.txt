Chinese lifter Qiu Hongmei broke the world record in the clean
and jerk on Monday on her way to an Asian weightlifting
championship in the 58-kilogram class, state press reported.


The 24-year-old winner won the clean and jerk with a lift of 141
kilograms (311 pounds) at the Asian Championships being held in
eastern China's Taian city, beating the old mark held by her
compatriot Chen Yanqing by one kilogram, Xinhua news agency said.


"I've already broken her (Chen's) jerk record today and I will
certainly break the other two (snatch and total) records in the
future," Qiu said.


Chen is not participating in the ongoing championships.


Qiu hoisted a total of 241kg, with the 141kg world record in the
jerk and 100kg in the snatch.


Thongsuk Sureeat of Thailand, who finished third in the world
championship in 2006, took the silver at 214kg, while Yumnam Bala
Chanu from India settled for the bronze at 204kg.
