Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and exiled Hamas political
supremo Khaled Meshaal are scheduled to hold talks in Cairo on
Saturday, a senior Palestinian official said Monday.


Talks are to focus on the political partnership between Hamas and
main rival Fatah, which is headed by Abbas, and Palestinian
efforts to lift Western economic and diplomatic sanctions, said
the official on condition of anonymity.


A Palestinian unity government, putting Fatah and Hamas around
the same cabinet table for the first time, took office on March
17 after Abbas and Meshaal reached a power-sharing agreement in
Saudi Arabia on February 8.


That agreement sought to end months of factional fighting between
Fatah and Hamas supporters that left scores dead after Meshaal's
Islamist party won Palestinian legislative elections in January
2006.


The new government has since battled to end the diplomatic and
economic boycott imposed by the West on the previous Hamas-led
government for its refusal to recognise Israel and past Israeli-
Palestinian agreements.
