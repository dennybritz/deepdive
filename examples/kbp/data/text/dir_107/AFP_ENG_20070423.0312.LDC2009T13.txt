Russia on Monday warned Estonia of "serious consequences" if
plans go ahead to exhume bodies of Soviet soldiers buried under a
World War II memorial in the centre of the Estonian capital
Tallinn.


"The Russian ministry has delivered a note of protest to the
Estonian ambassador... calling on the Estonian authorities to
reject acts that will have serious consequences for relations
between Russia and Estonia," a statement from the foreign
ministry said.


Estonia announced last week that it will soon start the work on
removing the graves. Officials also plan to relocate the monument
itself.


Russia sees the large bronze statue of a Red Army soldier as a
memorial to those who defeated Nazi Germany. For many Estonians,
it is a painful reminder of 50 years of post-war occupation of
the Baltic state by the Soviets.
