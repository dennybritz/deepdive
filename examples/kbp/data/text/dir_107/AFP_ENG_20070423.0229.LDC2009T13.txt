Twenty-six people were killed and five injured when a bus plunged
off an overpass in southwest China on Monday, state press
reported.


The accident occurred in the morning rush hour when the bus fell
more than 20 metres (66 feet) off an overpass in Chongqing,
Xinhua news agency reported. The injured were in a stable
condition.


Initial investigations concluded that the bus was overcrowded and
speeding on the wet road when it crashed through a barrier and
plunged down toward the banks of a river, the report said.


Police said 31 people were on the bus when it crashed, but the
vehicle was only licensed to carry 25 passengers.


Twenty-two people were killed at the scene, while two died en
route to hospital. Another two died in hospital, Xinhua said in a
later report.


China's roads are among the most dangerous in the world. More
than 18,000 people were killed and more than 90,000 injured in
road accidents in the first quarter of 2007, according to
official figures.


In 2006, the figures showed around 245 people died on the roads
every day, although the World Health Organisation says the real
number could be twice that.


In October last year, 30 people were killed and 20 injured when
their bus plunged off an elevated ramp in another mountainous
section of Chongqing.
