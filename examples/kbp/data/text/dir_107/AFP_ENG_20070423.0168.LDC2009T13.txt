A remote-controlled bomb struck a vehicle of Afghanistan's
intelligence service Monday, killing six agents and wounding four
other people, police said.


The men were killed in Laghman province where a similar blast on
Sunday killed two intelligence agents, a bodyguard and a driver.
The province is about 120 kilometres (75 miles) from Kabul, the
capital.


"Six intelligence officers were killed in the blast and another
four were wounded," provincial police chief General Asil
Totakhail told AFP.


Totakhail blamed the attack on the "enemies of Afghanistan", a
term used by Afghan authorities to refer to fighters for the
Taliban movement that was driven from government in 2001.
