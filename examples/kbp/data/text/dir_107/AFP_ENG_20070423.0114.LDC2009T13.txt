A suicide bomber blew himself up outside a restaurant near
Baghdad's fortified Green Zone on Monday, killing seven people
and wounding 14, a security official said.


The bombing took place outside the Al-Yasmin restaurant near the
highly secured area which houses the Iraqi parliament and the US
embassy.


Another car bomb exploded in a parking lot, also near the zone
and close to the Iranian embassy, an AFP correspondent said.


A security official said one person was wounded in the blast in
the parking lot used largely by visitors going to the Iranian
mission.
