Malaysia said Monday that Southeast Asian nations will not give
up trying to restore democracy to Myanmar even though efforts to
coax along the military- ruled state have been unsuccessful.


Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar admitted efforts to encourage
democracy in Myanmar and to free detained pro-democracy leader
Aung San Suu Kyi had yielded few results, but said changes would
take time.


"To compel Myanmar is difficult as it is a free and sovereign
country," Syed Hamid was quoted as saying by the state Bernama
news agency.


"We have to use this approach (of coaxing them) although it may
take some time to influence the leaders there," he said.


The minister rejected suggestions that efforts by Malaysia and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations had reached an
impasse, saying that the military regime had "expressed
commitment to democracy."


"The thing is that they are apprehensive about how democracy can
flourish if not enough preparation is done, especially to ensure
political stability and national security," said Syed Hamid.


Citing regime change in Iraq, he said efforts to introduce
democratic reforms in any country would be pointless if it
descended into chaos in the process.
