An Olympic Airlines plane carrying 11 Greek deputies from the
European Parliament made an emergency landing in Munich, Germany,
following a bomb alert, the airline said on Monday.


An unknown caller contacted police in Athens claiming there was a
bomb on the flight from Athens to Brussels via Strasbourg,
carrying a total of 136 passengers, an airline spokeswoman told
AFP.


The Greek airline ordered the pilot to land in Munich where the
plane was being searched, she said.


The flight left Athens at 9:30 am (0630 GMT) and the bomb threat
came about 40 minutes later, just as the aircraft was flying over
Split, Croatia.


It landed safely in Munich at 10:46 am (0846 GMT). All the
passengers disembarked and were waiting in an airport terminal
while the plane was parked in a remote area of the tarmac during
the police search, an airport spokesman said.
