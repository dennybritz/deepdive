French fixed-line telecommunications operator Neuf Cegetel said
on Monday it was in exclusive talks to buy the French subdidiary
of Deutsche Telekom, Club Internet.


"The transaction should be completed by the end of the second
quarter," the group said in a statement.


It did not specify a price, but the business daily Les Echos said
it could be between 430 million and 460 million euros (583-624
euros million dollars).


Neuf Cegetel has been in competition with Free, its main rival,
for the deal.


Deutsche Telekom is seeking to get rid of several of its
subsidiaries as it seeks to deal with its financial problems.
