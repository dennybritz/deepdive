The European Commission expects to open talks with ASEAN, India
and South Korea on new free-trade pacts after winning members'
backing to launch negotiations, the EU's executive arm said
Monday.


European Union foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg formally
gave the Commission mandates to negotiate the new free-trade
agreements on behalf of the EU's 27 members.


Welcoming the move, the Commission said that the agreements could
add more than 40 billion euros (54 billion dollars) to EU exports
annually through new opportunities.


"Combined with a successful conclusion to the Doha round (of WTO
talks), these agreements will open new markets to EU businesses
and give a valuable boost to global trade," said EU trade chief
Peter Mandelson.


With the 2001 launch of WTO trade liberalization negotiations in
the Qatari capital Doha, the EU chose to focus on a multilateral
approach to trade at the expense of efforts to strike bilateral
deals.


But since the Doha talks ground to a halt in July in disputes
over farm trade, Brussels has tried to give a new push to
bilateral deals, a strategy already being pursued by the United
States and Japan.
