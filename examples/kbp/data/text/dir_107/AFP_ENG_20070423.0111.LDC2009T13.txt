Japan announced Monday it will hold next year's summit of Group
of Eight leaders in the northern resort of Lake Toya to showcase
the fight against global warming.


Lake Toya, a popular yet remote retreat on the northern island of
Hokkaido, features a volcano and natural hot spring spas.


"It fits the image of my plan to build a beautiful nation," Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe said on the Nippon Television network.


"I believe the environment will be a major theme of the summit,"
Abe said.


The site will also ensure tight security for what will likely be
US President George W. Bush's last G8 summit.


"Leaders of many nations will gather. So we considered the impact
that strict security measures might have on local residents," Abe
said.


Major cities such as the port of Yokohama and ancient capital of
Kyoto, a frequent host of international events, had also
campaigned for the Group of Eight summit.


Japan last hosted the G8 summit on the subtropical southern
island of Okinawa in 2000.


The G8 gathers leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States. This year's summit
will take place in June in Germany.
