Arcelor Mittal, the world's leading steel maker, said on Monday
it had finalised its acquisition of Mexican long steel producer
Sicartsa for 1.44 billion dollars (1.1 billion euros).


Arcelor Mittal had originally announced the acquisition from
Grupo Villacero in December. It said in a statement said the buy
had been finalised on Friday after it had obtained the regulatory
and competition approval clearance from the US and Mexican
authorities.


The deal was expected to create economies of scale of 130 million
dollars.


Arcelor Mittal said that the transaction would raise its presence
in Mexico where steel consumption was expected to rise by six
percent a year over the next 10 years.


Sicartsa, which has production sites in Mexico and Texas, had
sales of 956 million dollars in 2004 and has an annual capacity
of around 2.7 million tonnes.


Shares in Arcelor Mittal dropped 0.42 percent to 40.49 Euros
euros in Paris early trading, where the company is traded under
the name Mittal Steel. The overall Paris market was 0.14 percent
higher in early trading.
