South Africa will send a 100-member military team to train
security forces in the Comores ahead of the June presidential
elections in the Muslim-majority archipelago, a poll official
said Monday.


"About 100 men working under the aegis of the African Union will
arrive in Moroni on April 25 to train and organise the Comores
forces," Mohammed Kassim Zahahe from the national independent
electoral commission told AFP.


A total of 35 people have signed up to contest the June 10 and 24
polls but the national poll body will publish a final list of
candidates at the end of the month.


Zahahe said the Arab League, of which Comores is a member, could
send a similar force to train local soldiers before the ballot,
but added that a final decision had not been taken.


South Africa, the continent's biggest economy, often plays a
leading role in resolving conflicts or maintaining stability in
Africa either through mediation or peacekeeping and military
training missions.
