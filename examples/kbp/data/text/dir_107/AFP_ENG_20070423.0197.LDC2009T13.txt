Italian police said 45 people were arrested Monday on corruption
and fraud charges on Monday, accusing them of cheating to receive
European Union agriculture subsidies.


They are suspected of having cheated the EU out of 50 million
euros (68 million dollars) by lying about production, sales and
unsold fruit produce data, as well as by invoicing for non-
existing services.


The suspects include heads of cooperatives and fruit producers,
police in the southern Italian Calabria region, which took part
in the arrests, told AFP.


The group also includes civil servants tasked with checking the
validity of subsidy claims, a police spokesman said.


Of the 45, 15 suspects were being held by police and 30 placed
under house arrest in the Calabria, Tuscany, Lazio and Piedmont
regions.


In January 2006, 30 people were arrested in Italy and 56 others
charged for fraud aimed at obtaining 10 million euros in
subsidies under the EU's common agricultural policy.


In another scandal, involving top Italian officials, a European
Commission official, an assistant of a European parliamentarian
and a businessman were jailed last month for their part in a
corruption scheme to defraud the EU of millions of euros.
