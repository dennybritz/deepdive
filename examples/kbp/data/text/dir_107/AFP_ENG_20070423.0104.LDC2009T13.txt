A Jordanian man jailed for repeatedly molesting his two daughters
is set to have his sentence cut in half after his wife decided
not to press charges, the Jordan Times reported on Monday.


The unnamed man confessed to "forcefully molesting more than 75
times his daughters aged 15 and 13 since they were seven and six
years old" and was jailed for six years and eight months, the
paper said.


But his sentence is set to be cut to three years and four months
after his wife decided not to press charges against her husband.


The man reportedly threatened his daughters if they told anyone
about the molestation, but one of them went to the authorities
after he tried to pay her for sex.
