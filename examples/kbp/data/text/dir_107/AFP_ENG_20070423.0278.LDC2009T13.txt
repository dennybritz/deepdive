Greek police surrounded a high-security prison Monday after 28
inmates refused to return to their cells in protest at conditions
in the facility, officials said.


Prison director Constantin Tsevikos told AFP the inmates, all
hardcore offenders convicted for crimes such as murder and drug
trafficking, launched their protest in the morning and the
situation was "under control".


He said talks were underway with the inmates, who had made no
particular demands.


The prison has about 460 detainees but only 280 places.
