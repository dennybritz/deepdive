A banking consortium comprising Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland,
Santander of Spain and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis said on Monday
it had called off a meeting with Dutch bank ABN Amro to discuss a
takeover bid.


Earlier Monday, Britain's Barclays announced a friendly takeover
deal to buy ABN Amro to create Europe's second-largest bank in
the world's biggest ever global banking merger.


Under the agreement, ABN Amro would sell its US unit LaSalle
Bank, which it is selling to Bank of America for 21 billion
dollars (15.5 billion euros), as a condition of the deal.


However, the Dutch bank had been due to meet the European banking
consortium later Monday over a possible separate offer.


"In view of ABN Amro's decision to sell LaSalle Bank to Bank of
America, the banks need to understand the circumstances under
which this sale can be terminated," the consortium statement
said.


"The banks are requesting this information today. Accordingly,
the banks do not consider it appropriate to meet with ABN Amro
today."
