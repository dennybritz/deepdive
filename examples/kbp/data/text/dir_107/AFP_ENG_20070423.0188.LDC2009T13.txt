The wail of sirens sounded across Israel on Monday, marking a
two-minute silence on Memorial Day for soldiers killed in the
country's eight wars and for the victims of militant attacks.


Speaking at a ceremony at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl in
Jerusalem, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel's duty to the
fallen soldiers was to improve the way of life in the country and
to fulfil aspirations for peace.


"The example of their heroism will be an oath of allegiance to
honour, love and protect this precious and good country, our
national home," Olmert said.


"We will defend it with daring and determination from every enemy
and foe, and will be prepared and ready to remove any threat and
danger," he added.


He said Israel's duty to the fallen was "to examine seriously
every diplomatic initiative... to be prepared for far-reaching
compromises and even very painful concessions, as long as our
vital and existential interests are preserved, in order to
fulfill our powerful aspiration to peace."


Over the past year, 233 soldiers and civilians have been killed,
including more than 160 who died in the war in Lebanon last
summer which Olmert ordered after Hezbollah captured two Israeli
soldiers in a deadly cross-border raid.


Israeli security forces were placed on maximum alert for Memorial
Day and for Independence Day, which follows at sunset on Monday
when Israel will begin to mark the 59th anniversary since its
creation in 1948.
