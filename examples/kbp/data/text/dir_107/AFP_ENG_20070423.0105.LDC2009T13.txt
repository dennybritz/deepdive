Zambia's high court has nullified results for two parliamentary
seats in last year's elections after upholding complaints that
the victorious ruling party candidates had bribed voters, an
official said Monday.


"The opposition succeeded in their petition in two
constituencies," the court registrar announced in a decision
which paves the way for by-elections in the constituencies of
Kapoche and Nalolo.


President Levy Mwanawasa and his Movement for Multiparty
Democracy (MMD) was comfortably re-elected in last September's
presidential and parliamentary elections, but the opposition
claimed the results were rigged and petitioned the high court in
Lusaka over the results in a number of constituencies.


The petitions challenging the results in Kapoche and Nalolo had
charged that the MMD had intimidated voters, offered financial
incentives in election material and even distributed money.


The high court is still to rule on petitions challenging the
results in several other constituencies.


MMD spokesman Benny Tetamashimba said that any lawmaker found to
have used corrupt methods would not be allowed to stand again in
the by-elections.


"We shall not adopt candidates whose elections were nullified as
a result of corrupt practices," Tetamashimba said.
