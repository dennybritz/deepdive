Hong Kong share prices closed flat Monday as a sharp drop in
large-cap China Mobile negated early gains driven by Wall
Street's record finish on Friday, dealers said.


They said China Mobile slumped after announcing lower-than-
expected margins of earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortization for the first quarter, while some
investors also turned cautious due to renewed concerns over
possible policy-tightening measures in China.


The Hang Seng Index closed down 10.02 points at 20,556.57, off a
high of 20,757.41 and a low of 20,529.07. Turnover was 50.55
billion Hong Kong dollars (6.5 billion US).
