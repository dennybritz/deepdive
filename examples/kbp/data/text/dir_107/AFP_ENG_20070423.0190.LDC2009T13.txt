A Singapore judge Monday ordered a veteran opposition figure to
pay a 150,000-dollar fine within three weeks to emerge from
bankruptcy, which has kept him out of politics.


Singapore's Court of Appeal rejected the 81-year-old J.B.
Jeyaretnam's offer to pay less than the 233,255 Singapore
(154,477 US) dollar fine.


"We are giving you a conditional discharge provided you pay the
amount three weeks from today," said Chief Justice Chan Sek
Keong. Chan heads the three- member Court of Appeal whose
decision is final.


Jeyaretnam said he would to pay the amount. "If I am forced to
accept it, I will accept it because I want to be discharged," he
told the court.


Jeyaretnam was made bankrupt in 2001 after a court awarded
punitive damages to ruling party leaders who sued him for
defamation.


This made him ineligible to run in general elections that year.
Under Singapore law, a bankrupt cannot run for public office.


In 1981, Jeyaretnam made political history when he became the
first opposition politician to be elected MP.


He was re-elected in 1984 but two years later he was forced to
give up his parliamentary seat after being fined and sentenced to
one month in jail following lawsuits filed by political
opponents.


Human rights groups have criticised the Singapore government for
using libel laws as a tool to silence critics, but leaders of the
ruling People's Action Party dismiss such allegations, saying
they have to protect their reputations.
