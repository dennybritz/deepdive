More than 200 women and children rallied in the Pakistani capital
on Monday and urged the government to act against a
fundamentalist mosque for promoting a Taliban-style justice
system.


Demonstrators from civil society organisations chanted slogans of
"No to religious extremism," and "No to Taliban-style governance"
as they gathered outside parliament.


The protest was the latest in a series against the Lal Masjid or
Red Mosque in Islamabad, which has launched morality patrols
targeting video shops and set up its own Islamic court.


"Religious extremism is not merely confined to this mosque, it is
spreading all over Pakistan and this should concern the
government," leading rights activist Farzana Bari told AFP.


Hundreds of people marched against extremism in Islamabad on
April 19 after thousands took to the streets of Karachi the
previous week.


The leader of the mosque, Abdul Aziz, earlier this month
threatened the government with suicide attacks if it tried to
shut down his new Islamic court.


The court then issued a fatwa, or Islamic decree, calling for the
sacking and punishment of Tourism Minister Nilofar Bakhtiar after
she was pictured hugging a foreign paragliding instructor
following a charity event.


The government of military ruler President Pervez Musharraf has
been in negotiations with the mosque's leaders in a bid to avert
a potentially violent confrontation.
