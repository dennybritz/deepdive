The United States' missile defence plans threaten to seriously
destabilise regional and global security, Russian Defence
Minister Anatoly Serdyukov told his US counterpart on Monday.


"We believe the strategic missile defence system is a seriously
destabilizing factor that can have a significant influence on
regional and global security," Serdyukov told US Defence
Secretary Robert Gates, through an official interpreter.
