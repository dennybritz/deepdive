Iran has flogged two men in public and one woman behind closed
doors for moral corruption in the northeastern Khorasan Shomali
province, the student ISNA news agency said on Monday.


"Two men and a married woman were arrested for moral corruption
and sentenced to 100 lashes each. The verdict was carried out for
the men in public and elsewhere for the woman," ISNA quoted a
local prosecutor as saying.


The report said the men were lashed in a town square in the town
of Ashkhaneh.


The punishment for adulterers under Iran's Islamic sharia law is
flogging and death by stoning. But the judiciary says it has not
carried out stoning sentences since 2002.
