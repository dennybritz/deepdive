An Indian rocket carrying an Italian satellite blasted into space
Monday, state television showed, in the country's first ever
foray into the commercial space business.


The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) was shown blasting off
on schedule at 3:30 pm (1000 GMT) from Sriharikota spaceport, 80
kilometres (50 miles) north of Chennai in southern India.


The 352-kilogramme (774-pound) Italian astronomical satellite
'Agile' ebing carried will be used to gather information about
the origins of the universe.


India wants to compete with the United States, Russia, China, the
Ukraine and the European Space Agency in offering commercial
satellite launch services, a market worth up to 2.5 billion
dollars a year.


For Monday's launch of the Italian satellite, the Indian Space
Research Organisation (ISRO), which runs India's space programme,
is charging 11 million dollars, the Press Trust of India has
reported.


Space agency officials have confirmed the fee is close to that
figure.
