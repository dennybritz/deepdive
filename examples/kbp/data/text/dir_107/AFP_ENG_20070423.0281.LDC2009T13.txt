European Union observers monitoring Nigeria's elections on Monday
said the ballots fell far short of international democratic
standards and "cannot be considered to be credible."


Chief EU observer Max van den Berg told a news conference that
state elections held on April 14 as well as a presidential and
parliamentary vote on April 21 "have fallen far short of basic
international requirement standards for democratic elections."


"The elections were marred by poor organisation, lack of
essential transparency ... significant evidence of fraud,
particularly during the results collation process, voter
disenfranchisement ... and a lack of equal conditions for
contestants."


"As a result," he said, "the elections have not lived up to the
hopes and expectations of the Nigerian people, for the process
cannot be considered to be credible."
