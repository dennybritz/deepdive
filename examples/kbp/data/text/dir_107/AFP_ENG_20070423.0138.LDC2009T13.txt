Saudi Arabia on Monday beheaded by the sword three Iraqi drug
smugglers and a Saudi murderer, the interior ministry announced
in a statement carried by official media.


The three Iraqis, named as Amer Jassem Fahd al-Meshalawi, Seif
Saad Qawaf al- Meshalawi and Falah Kadhem Mahmud al-Hasnawi, were
executed in Arar in northern Saudi Arabia for smuggling hashish,
the SPA agency reported.


The statement did not say what the family relationship was
between the two Meshalawis.


Saudi national Abdallah bin Khalifa bin ali al-Saqri al-Anzi was
beheaded in the same place after being found guilty of killing a
compatriot.


The executions bring to 39 the number announced by the Saudi
government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public by beheading in
ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of
sharia, or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
