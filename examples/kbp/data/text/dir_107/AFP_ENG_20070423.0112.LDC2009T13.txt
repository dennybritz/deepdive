The Zambian government announced Monday that the country faced a
major electricity crisis as power generation capacity had not
kept pace with an economic growth spurt.


The energy ministry said in a statement that power supply would
be outstripped by demand by next year if no immediate solution
was found to avert the situation.


For a long time, Zambia has had a surplus in power capacity from
its main hydro- power plants which has allowed the country to
export to neighbouring nations.


"The surplus capacity in generation is expected to run out by
next year and has far-reaching implications on the national
economy," the statement said.


The government said the demand for power has been steadily
growing at an average rate of 150 megawatts per year but current
insfrastructure developments in the nation had pushed demand too
high.


The copper mining industry has experienced major development with
foreign investors opening up greenfield mines, while old mines
were being expanded following a surge in copper demand on the
foreign market.


"The current capacity from our major power stations is not able
to support this rate of growth," the statement said.


Zambia's power generation capacity stands at around 1,600
megawatts but needs to increase output to about 4,500 megawatts
by 2010.


The Zambian government has called for a national conference next
month to discuss the way forward on how to address the power
supply deficit.
