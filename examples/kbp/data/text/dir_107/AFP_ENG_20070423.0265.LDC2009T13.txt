At least 200 people were killed in election-related violence in
Nigeria between April 14 and 21, European Union observers said
Monday.


The EU said in a statement of preliminary findings that
casualties included both police and candidates to the
governorship polls on April 14, and the presidential and
legislative elections held a week later, April 21.


The violence "is unacceptable with respect to the right to life
and the democratic process," it said.


"The continuing and widespread use of thugs by a number of
political parties created a significant degree of fear and
intimidation," the EU report added.


Nigeria's chaotic elections have come under fire from both
foreign observers and the opposition, with calls mounting for a
re-run of the ballots.
