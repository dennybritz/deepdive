Blind British pilot Miles Hilton-Barber landed his microlight
aircraft in the northern Australian city of Darwin Monday as he
neared the end of his London- Sydney charity flight, a
spokeswoman said.


Hilton-Barber, 55, flew his Pegasus Mainair GT 450 to Darwin
international airport after strong headwinds forced him to make
an unplanned landing in Kununurra in a remote part of Western
Australia on Sunday.


The blind adventurer's arrival in Australia followed one of his
longest flights over water, from Kupang in Indonesia, said
spokeswoman Catherine Crawley.


Hilton-Barber, with a sighted co-pilot, will make several stops
within Australia before reaching Sydney on Saturday to become the
first blind pilot to fly half- way across the world.


He relies on speech-output from his navigation instruments to
steer his course, directing the microlight from a wireless
keyboard.


Hilton-Barber, who has been blind for 25 years, has travelled
13,500 miles (22,000 kilometres) across 19 countries with the aim
of raising one million pounds (1.5 million euros, 1.9 million
dollars) to fight preventable blindness in developing countries.


He is a motivational speaker who says "the only limits in our
lives are those we accept ourselves," and has climbed Mount
Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and completed a marathon in Siberia in a
series of adventures.
