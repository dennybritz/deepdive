The White House said Monday that it was "deeply troubled" by
deadly clashes and alleged irregularities that afflicted
Nigeria's elections and urged all sides to refrain from violence.


"We are deeply troubled by what we saw over the weekend,"
national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters as
international observers challenged the credibility of the vote.
