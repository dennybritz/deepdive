Several hundred traders ransacked and set fire to a police
station in central Guinea on Monday in reaction to alleged police
brutality, witnesses said.


Several witnesses said the traders attacked the station at
Kindia, some 130 kilometres (80.6 miles) east of Conakry, with
sticks and stones before setting it ablaze. Officers stationed at
the building fled before the attack.


Soldiers were called in to disperse the mob and restore order.


The attack came after a local merchant claimed that about 15
armed police had barged into his home overnight Saturday, tied
him and his wife up and raped his daughter. They also allegedly
stole property including money and gems.


Deputy national police chief Alpha Oumar Balde dismissed the
allegations, saying the attackers were "people disguised as
police".
