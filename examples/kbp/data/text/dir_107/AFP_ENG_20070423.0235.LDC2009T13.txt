A 22-year-old man who fell ill after completing the London
Marathon died on Monday, organisers said.


"It is with regret that we can confirm that a 22-year-old man
died peacefully this morning, having collapsed after successfully
completing the London Marathon yesterday," organisers said in a
statement.


"We offer our deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and
friends.


"We fully respect the wishes of his family not to release any
further details at this difficult time."


The London Marathon, held annually since 1981, is one of the most
popular in the world.


Sunday's race was run in challenging heat. The temperature nearly
hit 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit) at midday, almost
equalling the 1996 record, and later rose slightly.


The St John Ambulance medical charity said it treated 5,032
runners, 73 of whom were sent to hospital for further treatment.


"This year's event has been unusually hot and we have treated a
high number of people," said commissioner Seamus Kelly.


In the races, Kenya's Martin Lel won the men's event finishing in
2hrs 7min 41sec to beat Moroccan Abderrahim Goumri into second
with another Kenyan Felix Limo third.


The big surprise, though, was the abandonment of Ethiopian legend
Haile Gebreselassie.


Zhou Chunxiu made history as the first Chinese runner to win the
London Marathon as she came home in 2hrs 20min 38sec on Sunday,
finishing ahead of Ethiopia's Gete Wami and Romanian Constantina
Tomescu-Dita in the women's race.
