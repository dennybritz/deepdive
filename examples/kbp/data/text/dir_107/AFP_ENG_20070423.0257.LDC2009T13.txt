Pirelli chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera said on Monday that
there was more than one option for the sale of its stake in
Olimpia, the holding company that controls 18 percent of Telecom
Italia.


"With the negotiations with AT&T failed, negotiations are
ongoing with the Mexicans and there are also other options on the
table," Tronchetti Provera told a meeting of Pirelli
shareholders.


AT&T pulled out of talks to buy the stake earlier this month,
but the US firm's Mexican affiliate, America Movil, is still
interested.


Pirelli owns 80 percent  of Olimpia, while the Benetton family
owns the remaining 20 perceht.


Tronchetti told shareholders that Pirelli, "with a solid balance
sheet structure, is in no hurry".


On Monday the Italian daily La Stampa reported that Italian
banks, namely Intesa Sanpaolo and Mediobanca, are seeking to form
a consortium of Italian investors to join Spain's Telefonica SA
in buying a controlling stake in Telecom Italia.


US company AT&T said last week  it had withdrawn an offer for
a third of Olimpia.


In particular AT&T has been concerned about government plans
to make Italy's fixed line network open to allcomers, which would
mean it losing a key asset.
