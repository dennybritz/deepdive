Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said during a trip to Greece
on Monday that peace in the Middle East would help solve all the
world's conflicts.


"It is clear to everyone that peace in the Middle East... could
douse all the sources of tension in the world," he told reporters
here after talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas Caramanlis.


"We hope that in the near future, with the cooperation of the
international community and naturally the support of the United
States, we are going to make progress toward peace."


The Palestinian leader again called for the European Union to
lift a year-long suspension of direct aid to the Hamas-led
government.


He warned Saturday that the ongoing aid embargo, imposed after
Hamas militants came to power in the Palestinian territories a
year ago, would encourage "extremism".


The European Union was the biggest aid donor to the Palestinian
government until the Hamas militants came to power in March last
year.


The Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the EU, the United
States, the United Nations and Russia -- then suspended direct
aid to the Palestinian Authority.
