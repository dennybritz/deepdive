A Japanese former member of the French Foreign Legion was
arrested for allegedly selling smuggled weapons in his home
country, which has strict controls on guns, reports said Monday.


The Japanese man, 43, was arrested along with his wife and three
other people earlier this month, Jiji Press said.


Police confiscated eight guns and more than 1,000 bullets and
suspect he may have smuggled weapons into Japan for illegal sale
to firearms enthusiasts, it said, quoting police sources.


Police believe the man may have sold more than 10 other handguns
in Japan, using contacts acquired during his military service,
Kyodo News said.


Police declined to comment on the reports.


Japan has tight controls on guns and was shocked last week by the
rare assassination of a mayor by a gangster.


Japan, which is officially pacifist, has produced dozens of
recruits to the Foreign Legion, which was set up in 1831 by King
Louis Philippe and is composed of volunteers of any nationality.


One Japanese former legionnaire, Akihiko Saito, was kidnapped and
apparently killed in 2005 by al-Qaeda militants in Iraq where he
had been hired by a British private security firm assisting US-
led military operations.
