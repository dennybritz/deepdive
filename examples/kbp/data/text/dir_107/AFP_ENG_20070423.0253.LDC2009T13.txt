Nigeria's largest local group monitoring elections demanded on
Monday the cancellation of last weekend's vote for the country's
president and parliament, slamming the polls as "a charade"
staged by the government.


"Our monitors throughout the country... documented numerous
lapses, irregularities and electoral malpractices that
characterised the election in many states," Innocent Chukwuma,
head of the transition monitoring group (TMG), told journalists.


Irregularities were so numerous and so far-reaching that "the
election was a charade and did not meet the standards required
for democratic elections," he said.


"We therefore reject it and call for its cancellation," he said,
demanding a rerun within three months. The group had 50,000
monitors on the ground.


It blamed election shortcomings on the Nigerian government and on
the electoral commission (INEC), accusing them of having "failed
wilfully in their responsibility to conduct free, fair and
credible elections."


Turning to world opinion, Chukwuma said: "We call on the
international community not to recognise these discredited
elections and not to confer legitimacy on any government that
emerges therefrom."
