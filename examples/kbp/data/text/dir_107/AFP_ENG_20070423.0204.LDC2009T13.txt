Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari will visit Tehran on
Wednesday to urge Iran to attend an international conference on
Iraq scheduled for next month in Egypt, diplomats said.


"Mr Zebari will visit Iran on Wednesday," a diplomat at the Iraqi
embassy in Tehran told AFP, without elaborating further and on
condition of anonymity.


Zebari has already said that he will visit Iran this week, and he
also plans to visit Turkey and may later travel to Syria, saying
"their participation is crucial for the success of this meeting
and for Iraq."


Tehran has still to confirm its attendance at the conference of
ministers from the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, the Group of Eight and Iraq's neighbours in
Sharm el-Sheikh on May 3 and 4.


The meeting will aim to try to find ways to end Iraq's bloodshed
by mobilising foreign powers in support of Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki's government and by isolating extremist factions.


Iran -- which the United States accuses of stirring trouble in
its neighbour -- has demanded the release of five Iranian
officials held in Iraq by US forces and also expressed doubts
about the inclusion of world powers in the meeting.
