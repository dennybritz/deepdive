Stockholm schools that banned sweets, buns and soft drinks saw
the number of overweight children drop by six percentage points
in four years, a Karolinska Institute study published on Monday
showed.


The number of overweight or obese six-to-10-year-olds dropped
from 22 to 16 percent in the 10 Stockholm schools that
participated in the study by banning sweets and introducing
healthier lunches, the Swedish research institute said in a
statement.


A control group of schools that did not introduce specific food
regulations saw the number of overweight or obese children rise
from 18 to 21 percent.


The results of the project were to be presented on Monday in
Budapest at an international conference on obesity.


"Our results show that programmes to reduce the increasing rate
of obesity can be carried out within the schools' existing
budgets," the head of the project, Professor Claude Marcus, said
in the statement.


"We also interpret the results to mean that clear regulations in
schools can help parents to set standards for their children and
improve dietary habits at home," it said.
