National carrier Malaysia Airlines will be compensated by Airbus
for the delay in the delivery of its A380 super-jumbo planes, a
top official from the European firm said Monday.


"Absolutely, there will be some compensation for them," Airbus
chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy, was quoted as
saying by state Bernama news agency.


"We have to come up with the date when they want the aircraft,
then we will look at it," Leahy said, referring to the amount of
compensation.


He said delivery dates and the compensation would be ironed out
in talks with Malaysia Airlines within the next few months.


The carrier has an order for six A380s and has said that delivery
delays would not hurt its recovery plan.


"We are having on-going discussions with Airbus on the
compensation and the new delivery date. No decision has been made
yet," Malaysia Airlines said in a statement to Bermama.


Leahy also confirmed that there were no cancellations from
Malaysia Airlines for the orders.


"I don't see any indication that they wouldn't be taking the
aircraft. We just need to put in the dates," he said.


Deliveries of the A380, the world's largest commercial airliner
and the cornerstone in Airbus efforts to catch up with Boeing,
are now two years behind schedule because of production problems.


Last month the struggling aircraft manufacturer saw strikes of
thousands of Airbus workers across Europe after announcing 10,000
job cuts in a bid to solve a crisis caused mainly by problems
with its A380 superjumbo jet.
