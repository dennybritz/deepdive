Three men convicted of the 2004 theft of expressionist
masterpiece "The Scream" received prison sentences of up to nine-
and-a-half years here Monday.


A Norwegian appeals court handed out sentences ranging from five-
and-a-half to nine-and-a-half years and ordered the men to pay a
total of 1.57 million kroner (194,000 euros, 263,000 dollars) in
damages to the city of Oslo.


The money will cover the loss of income at the city's Munch
Museum and repairs to Edvard Munch's "The Scream" and "Madonna",
which was also stolen in the heist.


Two armed masked robbers snatched the paintings from the Munch
Museum in August 2004 in a daring daytime raid.


The works were recovered in August last year. The circumstances
of their recovery and whereabouts while stolen remain a mystery.


Only one of the two men who actually entered the building to
steal the paintings, Stian Skjold, was convicted. His accomplice
died of a heroin overdose on November 3 before he could be
charged, police said.


The two other convicted men were Petter Tharaldsen, the gang's
driver, and Bjoern Hoen who was one of the brains behind the
heist.


Tharaldsen received the heaviest sentence of nine-and-a-half
years, but the period also covers another armed robbery for which
he was convicted.


Hoen was handed a nine-year sentence while Skjold received five-
and-a-half years.


The prosecution had sought terms of 10, 12 and seven years
against Tharaldsen, Hoen and Skjold.


The three had pleaded not guilty.
