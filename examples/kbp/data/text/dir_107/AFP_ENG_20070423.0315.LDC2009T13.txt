Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said Monday his country
strongly supports Croatia's bid to join the European Union and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, or NATO.


"The Slovak government is in maximum support of Croatia becoming,
as quickly as possible, a member of the two international
organisations (EU and NATO)," Fico told a joint press conference
with his Croatian counterpart Ivo Sanader.


Bratislava also aims to help Croatia with the integration
process, he said.


"It would be good if we could give them a few words (of advice)
on our mistakes (during Slovakia's integration into the EU) that
they can learn from," Fico said.


Sanader meanwhile said Croatia "expected the invitation the join
NATO next year," and that the country hoped to wrap up membership
talks with the EU in 2008 and to join the bloc by 2009.


Croatia launched membership negotiations with the EU in October
2005.


The European Commission has however said that no more member
states would be admitted before the stalemate over its
constitution, rejected in Dutch and French referendums in 2005,
had been resolved.


The 27-member bloc is aiming to adopt a new treaty by mid-2009.
