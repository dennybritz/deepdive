US-based private equity fund Lone Star is preparing to sell at
least half of its 67 percent stake in Tokyo Star Bank, with
Britain's HSBC one of several possible buyers, a report said
Monday.


Lone Star is expected to pick a buyer for the shares by early May
and complete the sale via a tender offer by the end of June
subject to regulatory approval, the Nikkei business daily
reported in its evening edition.


Other possible buyers are Japanese investment firm Advantage
Partners LLP, US fund TPG Inc. and RHJ International, formerly
known as Ripplewood Holdings, the report said, quoting unnamed
sources close to the matter.


Lone Star is expected to sell at least 34 percent of its shares
in Tokyo Star Bank, enough to transfer management rights, and
could net as much as 300 billion yen if it sells all of its
holdings, the paper added.


If HSBC wins control of the Tokyo bank it would be the first
foreign financial institution to acquire a Japanese bank's
domestic retail operations, the Nikkei noted.


Tokyo Star Bank was formerly Tokyo Sowa Bank, which collapsed in
1999 under a mountain of bad debt. It started new life under Lone
Star in 2001.


Lone Star had aimed to sell its shares in the bank to Nikko
Cordial but that plan was scuppered by an accounting scandal at
the Japanese securities firm.
