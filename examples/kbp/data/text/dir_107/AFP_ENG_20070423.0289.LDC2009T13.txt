Beijing planners have decided to raze a Ming Dynasty theatre in
the heart of the old city that once provided a historic backdrop
to the famous Peking Opera, state press said Monday.


The Guanghe Theatre, which sits in Beijing's historic Qianmen
quarter, will meet the wrecking ball, making way for the
capital's "remorseless" onslaught of modernisation, Xinhua news
agency reported.


"It appears that yet another of the country's cultural heirlooms
is doomed," the state-run agency lamented.


Culture officials hope to build a new modern theatre in the
district that will be a professional venue "like those on
Broadway in the United States," the report said.


The Guanghe theatre was where Peking Opera master Mei Lanfang
started his illustrious career over 100 years ago, later becoming
one of the genre's greatest stars.


Mei was immortalised in the award-winning film by Chen Kaige,
"Farewell My Concubine."


The theatre was built in the final years of the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) and served as a mansion for a rich merchant before it
was turned into one of the capital's many Peking Opera houses.


It continued to stage operas into the 1970s, but fell into use as
audiences dwindled. In 2000 it was declared an unsafe building,
the report said.


The Qianmen quarter, which sits south of Tiananmen Square, is
going through a period of drastic remodelling with hundreds of
"hutong" courtyard homes demolished to make way for commercial
buildings and roads widened to accommodate the city's increasing
traffic.
