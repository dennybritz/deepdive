Oil Minister Sheikh Ali Jarrah al-Sabah said Monday he would
appoint a new chief for the national oil conglomerate Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. (KPC) by the end of September.


Hani Hussein, the outgoing KPC chief executive officer, resigned
earlier this month "based on his personal wish," the minister
told reporters, denying any rift.


Sheikh Ali said that so far he has not named candidates to
replace Hussein, but any appointment must be confirmed by the
Supreme Petroleum Council, the emirate's highest authority on
oil, which is headed by the prime minister.


The minister said in statements earlier this month that he
intended to introduce changes in the management of Kuwaiti oil
companies by promoting young people to senior posts.


Hussein had served for about three decades in the emirate's oil
sector and was promoted to the top post in August 2004.


KPC was established in the early 1980s to oversee the emirate's
oil industry inside and outside Kuwait. Along with its several
subsidiaries it controls close to 100 billion barrels of crude
reserves.


The minister also announced the discovery of a new gas field in
the north of the country but declined to provide any details on
its size.


Kuwait in 2005 announced its first discovery of free natural gas
when it found reserves amounting to 35 trillion cubic feet (one
trillion cubic metres) in the north of the country.


Sheikh Ali also said authorities would decide next month on the
future of a multi-billion-dollar project to build a new refinery
after bids made by foreign companies highly exaggerated the cost.
