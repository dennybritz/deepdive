Eritrea on Monday dismissed reports that eight Ethiopian hostages
seized last month in the remote Afar desert had been released in
Eritrea, saying they never left their own country.


"It was an Ethiopian matter, of Ethiopians being kidnapped by
Ethiopians," said Information Minister Ali Abdu.


"Eritrea had nothing to do with it," Ali told AFP.


On Sunday, Ethiopian state-media said the remaining hostages were
released in Eritrea.


But Ali said the claims of Eritrean involvement were designed to
divert attention from its own internal opposition.


"Why should these people put the name of Eritrea in every
statement they make?" Ali said. "I am afraid if tomorrow an
earthquake happens in Ethiopia, then Eritrea will be blamed. For
them, it is a public relations exercise to damage our name."


The Ethiopian drivers and guides were abducted at gunpoint with a
British embassy-linked group of three men and two women on March
1 in northeast Ethiopia, but the Europeans were freed after 12
days.


Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a bitter territorial war between 1998
and 2000 and are still at odds over their unresolved border
dispute.
