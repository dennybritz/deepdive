Denmark's Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik left a
Copenhagen hospital on Monday after welcoming their second child
at the weekend, an as-yet- unnamed baby girl.


The couple left the Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University
Hospital) followed by dozens of photographers and journalists, as
several television stations broadcast images of the event live.


Hundreds of curious Danes also waited outside the hospital,
waving the Danish flag as they hoped to catch a glimpse of the
new princess, born on Saturday, and her parents.


"She slept well ... She has been very good and kind to her
mother," a smiling Princess Mary told journalists as she cradled
her daughter, who was dressed in white and covered with a shawl.


"We have not decided on a name yet but we are considering a few,"
the princess said, noting that the baby "has got my black hair."


The new princess is third in line to the throne after her father,
Crown Prince Frederik, and brother, Prince Christian, born
October 15, 2005.


Prince Christian was not with the family when they left the
hospital but had visited his new sister over the weekend.


"He gave her a little friendly tap on the head," Princess Mary
said, adding that "he showed a little bit of boyish love."


The princess did not rule out the possibility of having more
children in the future.


The couple and their newborn drove off to cheers and applause
from the crowd to the Fredensborg castle north of Copenhagen, the
summer residence of Frederik's mother, Queen Margrethe II.


Australian-born Mary Donaldson, 35, married Prince Frederik, 38,
in May 2004.
