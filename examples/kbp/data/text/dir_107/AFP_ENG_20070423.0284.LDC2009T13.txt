Sri Lanka stopped Nordic peace brokers from visiting Tamil Tiger
rebel-held territory on Monday as warplanes bombed suspected
guerrilla positions in the island's north.


Colombo told Norway's top envoy here, Hans Brattskar, not to
proceed with his planned visit to the town of Kilinochchi, 330
kilometres (206 miles) north of here, for "security reasons."


"Citing security reasons, the government last night asked the
Norwegian diplomat not to go ahead with the visit," a diplomatic
source close to the peace process said. "They have not said when
the visit can take place again."


Brattskar had met with Sri Lanka's peace negotiator Nimal
Siripala de Silva, who is also the health minister, as part of
routine consultations with the warring parties in the island.


Norwegian-brokered talks between the two sides ended in failure
in October and led to more fighting in the island's embattled
north and east despite an Oslo- arranged truce agreed in February
2002.


The government directive came as airforce fighter jets pounded a
suspected Sea Tiger base in the island's northern district of
Jaffna around noon on Monday, the defence ministry said.


Nordic truce monitors say the ceasefire is holding only on paper.
More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
since December 2005.


Tamil Tiger rebels are leading a drawn-out campaign for
independence. More than 60,000 people have been killed in the
conflict since the launch of the Tiger rebel movement in 1972.
