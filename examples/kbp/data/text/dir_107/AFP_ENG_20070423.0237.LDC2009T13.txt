Most Japanese lawmakers shunned a controversial war shrine Monday
on its annual festival amid efforts to mend ties with China and
South Korea.


The Yasukuni shrine, which venerates 2.5 million Japanese war
dead including 14 top World War II war criminals, has been a
thorn in relations in Asia, with Beijing and Seoul viewing it as
a symbol of imperialism.


On Monday, 39 of the 722 members of Japan's parliament went to
the Shinto shrine for its annual spring festival, a popular
gathering time for veterans and other supporters.


Two cabinet members without ministerial portfolios were among the
pilgrims, although no ministers went, according to a lawmakers'
group backing the Yasukuni shrine.


In last year's spring festival, nearly 200 Japanese lawmakers or
their representatives visited the war shrine.


The past pilgrimage took place during the tenure of former prime
minister Junichiro Koizumi who visited the shrine each year,
infuriating China and South Korea.


Shinzo Abe, who succeeded Koizumi in September, was a staunch
supporter of shrine visits in the past but has kept a strategic
silence on whether he will go as prime minister.


"The prime minister has his own ideas on the issue. It's a matter
for him to decide himself," Yoshinobu Shimamura, a former farm
minister who heads the group of pro-shrine lawmakers, told
reporters after the group visit.


Abe went to visit Beijing and Seoul just days after taking office
in an effort to improve relations soured under Koizumi.


Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao paid a landmark return visit last week
to Japan where he sounded conciliatory on history issues.
