Palestinian interior minister Hani al-Qawasmeh on Monday
submitted his resignation to prime minister Ismail Haniya who
refused his request to step down, a government spokesman said.


"He submitted his resignation to the prime minister but the
latter refused and asked him to remain in his post," Ghazi Hamad
told reporters in Gaza City.


Hamad linked Qawasmeh's decision to resign to the "professional
situation within the interior ministry and the obstacles he is
facing."


Qawasmeh is an independent who was totally unknown in political
circles before being made interior minister in the Palestinian
national unity government that took office on March 17.


The government took office after a February power-sharing deal
brokered by Saudi Arabia sought to end months of deadly factional
fighting between Haniya's Hamas party and main rival Fatah, and
end a Western aid freeze.
