South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun and  Azerbaijani President
Ilham Aliyev agreed Monday to boost cooperation in trade and
other fields, officials said.


The accord was sealed at a summit between Roh and Aliyev, who
arrived in Seoul earlier for a three-day state visit.


The two leaders also agreed to deepen relations in energy,
natural resources, construction and information technology, Roh's
office said.


The two countries sealed accords on investment guarantees and
dual tax avoidance, it said.


Aliyev, the first Azerbaijani head of state to visit Seoul since
the establishment of ties in 1992, supported efforts to end North
Korea's nuclear programme through dialogue.


Roh called for the peaceful settlement of a row between
Azerbaijan and Armenia, the president's office said.


Aliyev urged South Korean firms to take part in Azerbaijan's
energy and infrastructure development projects, it said.


Last year the two countries signed an accord to allow South
Korean companies to participate in Azerbaijan's Inam oil well
project in the Caspian Sea.
