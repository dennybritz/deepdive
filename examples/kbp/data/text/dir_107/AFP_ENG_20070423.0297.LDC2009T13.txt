Iran on Monday urged EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to
avoid any talk of preconditions in talks on its nuclear
programme this week and instead present "new initiatives" to end
the standoff.


The comments by Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani
indicate that he has no intention of offering any halt to
sensitive uranium enrichment activities when he meets Solana in
Turkey on Wednesday.


"Solana should not talk about preconditions. New conditions mean
there are new requirements and new initiatives should be
presented," Larijani said, according to the Mehr news agency.


"Artificial views and diplomatic dancing in talks will have no
result and new initiatives must be presented in the talks," added
Larijani.


It remains to be seen what the outcome of the talks can be given
Iran's insistence it has no intention of halting sensitive
uranium enrichment operations, the key sticking point in the
five-year standoff.


The United States and European Union have said negotations can
only start if Iran freezes enrichment. Tehran however says it
will only negotiate with no preconditions and will never suspend
enrichment.
