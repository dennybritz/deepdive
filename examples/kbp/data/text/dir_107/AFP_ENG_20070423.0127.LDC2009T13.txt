Sri Lanka asked peace broker Norway to suspend a planned visit
Monday to Tamil rebel-held territory in the island's north,
diplomatic sources said.


The Sri Lankan government told Norway's top envoy here, Hans
Brattskar, not to proceed with his visit to the town of
Kilinochchi, 330 kilometres (206 miles) north of here, for
"security reasons."


"Citing security reasons, the government last night asked the
Norwegian diplomat not to go ahead with the visit," a diplomatic
source close to the peace process said. "They have not said when
the visit can take place again."


Brattskar had met with Sri Lanka's peace negotiator Nimal
Siripala de Silva, who is also the health minister, as part of
routine consultations with the warring parties in the island.


Norwegian-brokered talks between the two sides ended in failure
in October and led to more fighting in the island's embattled
north and east despite an Oslo- arranged truce agreed in February
2002.


Nordic truce monitors say the ceasefire is holding only on paper.
More than 4,000 people have been killed in a new wave of fighting
since December 2005.


Tamil Tiger rebels are leading a drawn-out campaign for
independence. More than 60,000 people have been killed in the
conflict since the launch of the Tiger rebel movement in 1972.
