Some ten people will go on trial soon for last year's shooting of
a Senegalese student in Saint Petersburg, prosecutors said
Monday.


"The invesigation into the murder of Samba Lampsar Sall is almost
finished, and around 10 people will soon be sent for trial," a
spokesman said, refusing to give any more details.


A Senegalese daily Monday quoted the victim's father, Badara
Sall, as saying that 15 people were initially held for the
killing of his son in Russia's second city in April 2006, but
four were released because they were minors.


The remaining 11 stayed in custody, he said. The suspected leader
of the gang, Dmitry Borovokov, was killed last year by police who
tried to arrest him.


"I am satisfied with the way the case is being dealt with... the
investigation is almost complete," Sall told private newspaper
Wal-Fadjri.


He added that the inquiry had been delayed following the
discovery of new evidence but did not say what that was.


Samba Lampsar Sall, a 28-year-old telecommunications student born
in Moscow to Senegalese parents, was shot in the head as he left
a night club with other Africans. The weapon, a gun decorated
with a swastika, was recovered nearby.


Five Russian youths were initially arrested on suspicion of his
murder, which the authorities said was racially motivated.


They were members of an extreme nationalist group called the "Mad
Crowd", suspected of several attacks against foreigners and
Russian citizens from the Caucasus in 2002 and 2003.


The murder was part of a spate of attacks on Africans and
prompted major protests across the city.
