German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom said Monday it
planned to slash entry-level wages by around one third to lower
staff costs as part of an ongoing cost-cutting programme.


Deutsche Telekom personnel chief Karl-Gerhard Eick said in a
statement that the group planned to lower pay for new employees
in customer service and network services to 20,000 euros (26,600
dollars) a year from 30,000-34,000 euros at present.


The German telecommunications giant would resume talks with the
giant services sector labour union Ver.di on Tuesday over plans
to spin-off around 49,000-50,000 staff to its newly-created
T-Service customer service division, where it would also discuss
entry-level wages, Eick said.


Ver.di had opposed the deep cost-cutting plans.


"If other market players who have also struck deals with Ver.di
have entry-level pay of around 17,000 euros, but longer working
hours, then our entry-level pay is unacceptable not only from an
economic point of view, but also from a social point of view,"
Eick said.
