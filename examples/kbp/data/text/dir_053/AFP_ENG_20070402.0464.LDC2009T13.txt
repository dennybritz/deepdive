Washington on Monday hailed a call from Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Olmert to Arab leaders to hold talks on a Saudi-drafted plan
for Middle East pace as a positive move.


"The idea that the Israelis and Arab states could get together in
some form just to have initial discussions about where the
situation stood and the ideas and proposals for how to move a
process or reconciliation forward, is positive," said State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack.


Olmert on Sunday invited the heads of Arab states to hold talks
with Israel over the Saudi-drafted plan.


"I invite all the heads of the Arab states, including of course
the Saudi king whom I consider a very important leader, to hold
talks with us," Olmert said in Jerusalem.


"If the Saudi king initiates a meeting of moderate Arab states
and invites me and the head of the Palestinian Authority in order
to present us the Saudi ideas, we will come to hear them and we
will be glad to voice ours," Olmert said.


At their summit in Riyadh last week, Arab leaders revived a five-
year-old plan that offers Israel normal relations if it withdraws
from all land seized in the 1967 Six Day War, and allows for the
creation of a Palestinian state and the return of Palestinian
refugees.


Israel rejected the plan when it was first adopted in 2002, but
has now said it could serve as a basis for talks provided there
were changes on the refugee issue, something the Arab heads of
state rejected in Riyadh.
