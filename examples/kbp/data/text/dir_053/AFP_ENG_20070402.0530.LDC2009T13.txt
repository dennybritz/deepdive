Ali Larijani, head of Iran's supreme national security council,
said Monday that the European Union had "started to condemn Iran
without knowing the facts" over the capture of 15 British naval
personnel.


He criticised the EU's expression last week of "unconditional
support" for Britain's position and its threat of "appropriate
measures" unless the captives were released quickly, in an
interview with Channel Four news.
