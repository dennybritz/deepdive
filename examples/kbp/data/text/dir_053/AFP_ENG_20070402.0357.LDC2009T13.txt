The Social Democratic party of Lithuanian Prime Minister
Gediminas Kirkilas called Monday for snap elections, saying an
early return to the polls would stop chaos in parliament.


"We see early elections as one possibility to end the current
situation in which parliament is unable to work," Ceslovas
Jursenas, deputy chairman of the Social Democratic Party, told
AFP.


"I have registered a draft law offering to hold early elections
on June 24," he said.


Lithuania's four-way coalition government, headed by Kirkilas,
does not have a majority in parliament. Since coming to power
last July it has got by thanks to support from the opposition
Conservative Party, which pledged to back it.


But last Thursday's parliamentary session bordered on chaos as
lawmakers spent half the day arguing about what was to be on the
day's agenda -- and the conservatives did not back the
government.


They have expressed dissatisfaction recently with the
government's policies and have threatened to withdraw their
support for the coalition.


Lithuania's law allows for the calling of early elections if at
least 85 lawmakers in the 141-member parliament support the move.


Early elections can also be called by the president if parliament
twice rejects the government programme presented by a new prime
minister.


The current government is the 14th since independence from the
Soviet Union in 1991.


The next parliamentary elections in the Baltic state are
currently scheduled for the second half of 2008.
