A private investment company in the United Arab Emirates plans an
unprecedented one-billion-dollar (748-million-euro) development
in Morocco's historic southern city of Marrakesh, a local
official said Monday.


A Moroccan subsidiary of the UAE-based Reem Investments is to
build a complex comprising housing, three hotels, a golf course
and other attractions 10 kilometres (six miles) from the centre
of the city.


The official said the Atlas Garden project was the biggest yet in
the region, where the old fortified city on the edge of the Atlas
Mountains is proving increasingly popular to tourists.


The project will eventually create 6,500 jobs on completion in
five years' time. It will include three hotels with a total
capacity of more than 2,500 beds, gardens and other open spaces,
cultural and entertainment facilities and the 18-hole golf
course.


Reem Investments is part of an alliance of UAE property
developers called Al- Maabar. Two other partners, Sorouh and Al
Qudra Holding, are also active in Morocco.
