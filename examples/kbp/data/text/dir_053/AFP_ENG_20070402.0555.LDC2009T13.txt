Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, on Monday
revealed the name of one of its spies inside Britain's secret
service in the 1940s, the Interfax agency reported.


His name was Bogomolets -- Viktor Bogomolets -- codenamed Britt
by his handlers in Moscow.


A Russian emigre, he worked for Britain's Secret Intelligence
Service (SIS), better known today as MI6. Part of his work
involved liaising with the Polish and Romanian intelligence
services.


In 1945, "having understood that the struggle against his country
made no sense", he approached the Soviet services.


Working out of Cairo, the information he supplied on cooperation
with the foreign secret services was passed on in note form to
the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and his foreign minister
Vyacheslav Molotov, said the SVR.


The information was released as SVR General Lev Sotskov prepares
to release a book about Bogomolets, "Operation Tarantella", which
tells the story drawing on SVR archive material.


Russian President Vladimir Putin is himself a former member of
the Soviet-era KGB.


But the assassination of former Russian agent-turned-critic
Alexander Litvinenko in Britain in November led to accusations
from his associates that Russian agents had been responsible for
poisoning him.


Litvinenko was found to have high levels of the radioactive
isotope polonium 210 in his body when he died.
