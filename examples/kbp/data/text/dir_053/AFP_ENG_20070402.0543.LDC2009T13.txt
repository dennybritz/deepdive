A six-strong panel of UN human rights experts on Monday called on
the military junta in Myanmar to end "discrimination" against the
Muslim minority in the western state of North Rakhine.


The panel, from the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OCHR), noted that the Muslim
minority, known as the Rohingyas, had been denied full
citizenship under a 1982 law.


The effect of this had been to severely limit their civil rights,
said a statement from the experts.


"This includes severe restrictions on freedom of movement;
various forms of extortion and arbitrary taxation; land
confiscation and forced evictions; restricted access to medical
care, food and adequate housing; forced labour; and restrictions
on marriages," said the statement.


"As a consequence, thousands have fled to neighbouring countries,
in turn creating complex humanitarian situations in the region."


In a speech last week, Senior General Than Shwe rebuked countries
such as the United States for having criticised the junta over
its human rights record.


"Judging from lessons of the history, it is certain that powerful
countries wishing to impose their influence on our nation will
make any attempt in various ways to undermine national unity," he
said.


Last Tuesday's hour-long speech came the day the military regime
staged its annual military parade in the new capital city of
Naypyidaw.
