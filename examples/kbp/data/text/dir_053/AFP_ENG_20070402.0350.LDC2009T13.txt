Another senior Russian politician raised the prospect of doing
away with the two-term limit for Russian presidents Monday, just
days after a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin dismissed the
idea.


Ultra-nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, deputy speaker
of the lower house of parliament, the Duma, said the two-term
limit on presidential mandates should be lifted as part of a
package of constitutional reforms.


"We need to put in place a more progressive form of the state and
lift the limit on the number of presidential mandates," he said
during a visit to the eastern city of Krasnoyasrk in Siberia, the
Interfax agency reported.


Zhirinovsky's comments came days after similar comments by the
speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament.


Sergei Mironov told a senate session on Friday: "I suggest we
consider whether it is not necessary, considering the many, the
millions of appeals from our citizens, to revise this norm."


A spokesman for Putin responded Friday that the president's
position was unchanged. "The president does not believe there is
any need or use in changing the constitution," the spokesman,
Dmitry Peskov, told AFP.


Putin is obliged to stand down at the end of his second term next
year under a rule in the constitution barring the incumbent from
holding the post for more than two consecutive terms.


A presidential election is scheduled for March 2, 2008.


The Russian leader, who enjoys high popularity ratings, has been
asked repeatedly whether he would seek a third term and his
standard answer is that he will respect the constitution.
