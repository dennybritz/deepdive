England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff allayed fears over his
fitness ahead of Wednesday's Super Eights match against Sri Lanka
by taking a full part in training here Monday.


Flintoff was forced off the field during Friday's win over
Ireland in Guyana for treatment on his left ankle.


But he batted and bowled during practice at the Antigua
Recreation Ground and is now expected to face Sri Lanka at the
Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, the island's new home for
international cricket.


England need to win at least one of their two matches against Sri
Lanka and Australia (they play the world champions here on
Sunday) to have a realistic chance of reaching the semi-finals
for the first time since 1992.
