Ukraine's pro-Western president, Viktor Yushchenko has postponed
a visit to Moscow, scheduled for Tuesday, due to the political
crisis in his country, a Kremlin source told AFP.


"The Ukrainian side has asked to postpone the visit of President
Viktor Yushchenko, which was set to take place over the coming
days, due to the political situation in Ukraine," the source
said.


Yushchenko held crisis talks on Monday that could lead to snap
elections after months of political turmoil as thousands of
protesters rallied against his leadership in central Kiev.
