Zimbabwe's cash strapped state power company, ZEDC, is to be
allowed to hike rates by up to 350 percent, officials said
Monday.


Mavis Chidzonga, commissioner-general of the Zimbabwe Electricity
Regulatory Commission, said increases in the costs of goods and
services had led to "price distortions" which needed to be
removed in line with government policy.


"The percentage increases take into account soaring generation,
transmission and distribution costs involved in the supply of
electricity," she said in a statement.


Rates were expected to go up by 120 percent in June and by
another 50 percent in October, she said. Zimbabwe Electricity
Distribution Company (ZEDC) also increased tariffs in November.


Power supplies are erratic and families in cities are turning to
firewood for cooking and heating because of outages.


Chidzonga said local generation capacity was insufficient to
cover the country's winter needs, and that the need to import
electricity was inevitable.


The southern African nation imports 40 percent of its power needs
-- 100 megawatts a month from the Democratic Republic of Congo,
200 megawatts from Mozambique and up to 450 and 300 megawatts
from South Africa and Zambia respectively.


Imports are expected to stop in this year due to anticipated
shortages across southern Africa caused by increased demand.


Zimbabwe's economy has been on a downturn for the past five
years, characterised by four-digit inflation and shortages of
foreign currency and basic commodities.
