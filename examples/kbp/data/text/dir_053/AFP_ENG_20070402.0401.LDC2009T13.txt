A Chinese home whose owners caused a national sensation by
defying developers in a three-year dispute was demolished on
Monday, an AFP correspondent reported.


Workmen operating a backhoe completely obliterated the modest
brick house, one of China's most recognisable buildings thanks to
widely circulated pictures of it sitting defiantly in a massive
excavated pit.


Owner Wu Ping, dubbed 'Stubborn Nail' by Chinese media for her
part in the dispute, said all her family owners had left the
house safely before it was torn down.


But she refused to confirm state media reports that an agreement
had been reached.


"I can't talk about that now," she said.


When Wu was told the house was gone, she said simply: "Oh well."


A legal battle has raged since Wu rejected a compensation offer
to move out that was accepted by 280 other homeowners, holding up
a major property development.


She then filed a lawsuit maintaining that she cannot be forced to
leave and demanded the developers build her a new house in the
area.


Such disputes are rife in China, often involving illegal land
grabs by developers allegedly in collusion with the government
and Wu's case has generated a lively debate over property rights
protection.


The national parliament passed a landmark law last month that
solidified private property rights, partly to combat such
disputes.
