Utility back Gavin Henson has been ruled out of the remainder of
the season due to his nagging knee injury and fears it could cost
him a place in Wales' World Cup squad.


"I'm running out of time to get on this Australian tour and
further my goals for the World Cup," said Henson, whose six-week
rehabilitation time makes him a real doubt for Wales' tour down
under in May.


"I've just got to hope to get back to play some sort of part and
see where that takes me.


"It's wait and see, I'll have to look at it with the physio every
Monday - every week - and hopefully one day I'll get up and the
pain goes."


The 25-year-old has been struggling with a cruciate ligament
injury picked up against Sale in January.


If Henson misses out on the two-Test tour to Australia, he will
have just three warm-up internationals in August - against
England, Argentina and France - before the World Cup to earn
himself a place in the Wales squad.


The injury will rule Henson out of the Ospreys' EDF Energy Cup
final against Leicester at Twickenham on April 15, plus their
Celtic League run-in.


Ospreys physio Brian Downey said: "This effectively rules Gavin
out for the remainder of this season.


"He has made a massive effort to get himself available for the
EDF final, but as is often the case with this type of injury
there is no substitute for prolonged physiotherapy.


"Our focus will now be on getting Gavin back to fitness as soon
as possible but as it is likely to take six to eight weeks - his
Ospreys season looks to have ended."
