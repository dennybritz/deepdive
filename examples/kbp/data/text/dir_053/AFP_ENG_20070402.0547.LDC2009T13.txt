Iran's top security official said Monday that there was "no need"
for a trial in the case of 15 captured British naval personnel,
saying Tehran wanted to resolve the situation diplomatically.


Ali Larijani, the head of Iran's supreme national security
council, described the standoff as "quite resolvable" in an
interview with Britain's Channel Four television.


"Definitely our priority is to solve the problem through proper
diplomatic channels. We are not interested in having this issue
get further complicated," he said.


"We definitely believe that this issue can be resolved. And there
is no need for any trial."


He also claimed that the European Union had "started to condemn
Iran without knowing the facts" over the detention of the group
last month.


He accused the EU of using "the language of force" by expressing
"unconditional support" for Britain last week and threating
"appropriate measures" unless the captives were released quickly.


"Unfortunately some EU members also started to take positions and
it was interesting for me that prior to knowing that they were in
our territorial water or not... they started to condemn Iran
without knowing the facts," he said, through an interpreter.


"In other words, it means that EU members are making a mistake...
and that is the language of force and therefore the EU would have
no different position or attitude as compared to the United
States."
