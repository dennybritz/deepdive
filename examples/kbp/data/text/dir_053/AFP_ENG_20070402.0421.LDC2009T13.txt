France 24, the round-the-clock television news network launched
four months ago with a brief to provide a French perspective on
world events, on Monday added Arabic broadcasts to its progamme.


The channel, which until now broadcast in French and English,
will broadcast in Arabic to a potential 20 million households in
North Africa and the Middle East between 1400 GMT and 1800 GMT
daily, a spokeswoman said.


The remaining broadcast hours on France 24's new channel will be
filled with either English or French programmes, depending on the
country.


The Arabic broadcasts will have the same format as the English
and French ones: a 10-minute news bulletin every half hour,
followed by filed reports, debates, or features on sport, culture
or business as well as a weather report.


Outgoing French President Chirac was the prime mover behind
France 24, after he was angered by the prevalence of British and
US viewpoints aired on the English- language market-leaders BBC
World and CNN in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.


Station executives say the aim is to offer an alternative voice
in a world television news market dominated by the "Anglo-Saxon"
giants as well as the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera, which last month
opened a service in English.


France 24 is also due to launch a service in Spanish.
