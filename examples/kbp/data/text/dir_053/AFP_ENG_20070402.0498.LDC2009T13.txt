The Senegalese army said Monday that five of its troops taking
part in an African peacekeeping force in Darfur had been killed
in an attack by the rebel Sudan Liberation Army.


The attack on Sunday was the worst to hit the embattled African
Union contingent since it was first deployed in the western
Sudanese region in 2004.


The "detachment from the Senegalese contingent engaged in Darfur
as part of the African Union force was attacked in a cowardly way
while it was carrying out a relief operation at an isolated water
point," said Senegalese army spokesman Colonel Antoine Wardini.


He said in a statement the attack was "carried out by elements of
the SLA" in the early evening Sunday.


The SLA was a signatory to a peace accord for Darfur signed with
the Sudanese government last year.


The African Mission in Sudan (AMIS) force said earlier that
attack was carried out near the Chadian border.


The African Union has some 7,000 troops deployed in the region
but the ill- equipped contingent has failed to stem the violence
and 15 of its troops have been killed there since 2004.
