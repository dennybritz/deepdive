Desertification will drive 65 million Africans to seek refuge in
the West, an Algerian minister warned Monday at the opening of a
conference on the problem.


Cherif Rahmani, minister for territorial planning, said that by
2025 the number of people living in deserts would have doubled to
two billion people, including 750 million in Africa.


He called for international cooperation to stop the increasing
degradation of land.


It needed 400 million dollars over three or four years to
transform a hectare (2.47 acres) of semi-arid land into ground
that could be cultivated, he said.


"Desertification loses the world economy 48 billion dollars a
year, including nine billion in Africa," said Abdesselam
Chelghoum, the general secretary of the Algerian ministry for
agriculture and rural development.


The conference on desertification, which was jointly organised by
the Algerian parliament and the Pan-African parliament, runs
until Wednesday.


Participants include representatives from 20 African countries,
European deputies and international specialists in the field.
