Sudan's oil production is expected to reach 600,000 barrels per
day (bpd) this year, President Omar al-Beshir told parliament on
Monday.


Speaking at the inauguration of a new parliament session, Beshir
said the output would increase thanks to new oil fields coming on
stream.


Sudan's current output is estimated at around 500,000 bpd but
averaged only 365,000 bpd in 2006, well below levels predicted by
the government.


Asian heavyweights China, India and Malaysia are the main
investors in Sudan's oil industry, which is still under US
sanctions and recovering from two decades of north-south civil
war.


Sudan has attended Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
meetings as an observer for years, and is considering full
membership of the cartel.
