A Chinese home whose owners caused a national sensation by
defying developers in a three-year dispute was demolished on
Monday, an AFP correspondent reported.


Workmen operating a backhoe had completely obliterated the modest
brick house, one of China's most recognisable buildings thanks to
widely circulated pictures of it sitting defiantly in a massive
excavated pit.
