An American citizen has been missing in southern Iran for more
than a week, CNN reported Monday.


The network, quoting State Department officials, said the
American was believed to be working for an independent media
producer trying to set up interviews when he went missing on Kish
Island, off Iran's southern coast.


It said the man had not been in touch with his family or employer
for more than a week since disappearing on the island, a free-
trade zone under Iranian authority.
