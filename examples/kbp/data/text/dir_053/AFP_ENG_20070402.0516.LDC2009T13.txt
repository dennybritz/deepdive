Kevin Pietersen has backed England's misfiring top-order World
Cup batsmen and believes they will bounce back in Wednesday's
Super Eights clash with Sri Lanka.


Openers Ed Joyce and skipper Michael Vaughan, as well as number
three Ian Bell, have all struggled to make runs so far with
England relying on the likes of Pietersen and Paul Collingwood to
get them out of a hole.


"That happens in cricket and there's nothing you can do about
it," said Pietersen.


"You can look at it in hindsight, which is always the best sight,
and say it hasn't happened but anyone can get out, anyone can
suffer a slump in form.


"We are not going to point fingers at individuals. We are all
trying to the best for our country."


England, who lost to New Zealand in the first round before
securing their place in the Super Eights with wins against Canada
and Kenya, have looked sluggish in the tournament and were far
from their best in the victory against Ireland in Guyana last
week.


But Pietersen believes the team will step up a gear when they
face Sri Lanka, one of the favourites for the title, on
Wednesday.


"We all know what Sri Lanka can do and what their players are
capable of. We will have to train hard to counter it," said
Pietersen.


"For us the World Cup starts on Wednesday. There will be no
complacency."
