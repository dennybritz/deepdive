Armenia's ruling Republican party on Monday named Defence
Minister and presidential favourite Serge Sarkisian as the
country's new prime minister.


Sarkisian is a close ally of President Robert Kocharian, who is
expected to approve the nomination on Wednesday, parliamentary
speaker Tigran Torosian told AFP.


Sarkisian, 52, will succeed Andranik Margarian, who died of a
heart attack on March 25 after seven years as prime minister.


The defence minister is considered the favourite to replace
Kocharian when the president's second term expires next year.


Like Kocharian, Sarkisian is from the disputed region of Nagorno-
Karabakh and fought in the 1988-1994 war in which Armenia seized
the region from Azerbaijan.


He also chairs the Republican party's ruling council and is
expected to play a key role in the party's campaign for May 12
parliamentary elections.
