The head of Spanish stock market regulator CNMV announced his
resignation on Monday in a surprise move seen as linked to his
handling of German utility E.ON's long-running takeover bid for
Spain's Endesa.


In a letter posted on the regulator's website, Manuel Conthe gave
no reasons for the move, saying only that it was related to
CNMV's good governance guidelines.


He said he would explain the reasons for his decision in
parliament after the Easter holidays this weekend.


Conthe, appointed in 2004, has come under fire over his handling
of E.ON's 42.3 -billion-euro (56.4-billion-dollar) bid for
Endesa, Spain's biggest utility.


Last week the Spanish stock market regulator allowed E.ON to
raise its bid for Endesa to 40 euros per share from 38.75 euros.
The acceptance period for E.ON's bid for the Spanish utility ends
Tuesday.


At the same time CNMV has ruled that Italy's Enel and Spanish
building group Acciona must wait six months from the end of the
acceptance period before launching a counterbid for Endesa.


The two firms together own 46 percent of Endesa.
