A Chinese home at the centre of a long-running property row is to
be demolished on Monday after a deal was struck with its owners,
state media reported.


Wrecking equipment was set to move in after the home's owners,
who have fought a three-year battle over compensation, moved out
on Monday afternoon following a "negotiated agreement," the
Xinhua news agency said.


Owner Wu Ping was not immediately available for comment.


Pictures of Wu and Yang Wu's modest brick dwelling standing alone
in a massive excavated pit have caused a sensation in a country
where property disputes are increasingly common.


A legal battle has raged since Wu, dubbed the "stubborn nail,"
rejected a compensation offer to move out that was accepted by
280 other homeowners, holding up a major development.
