The US Supreme Court on Monday rejected an bid by dozens of
inmates of the Guantanamo Bay 'war on terror' camp to challenge
their detention without charge before a federal court, lawyers
said.


Three of the nine judges on the court said they would be prepared
to examine the case, one short of the number required for it to
be taken up by the justices under their rules of procedure.


The petition was filed on behalf of dozens of inmates of the
Guantanamo camp in Cuba, who have little prospect of facing
formal charges, a tribunal or a return to their home countries.
