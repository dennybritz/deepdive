The White House on Monday objected to House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi's looming visit to Damascus, saying she risked undermining
US-led efforts to isolate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.


"It sends the wrong message to have high-level US officials going
there to have photo opportunities that Assad then exploits," said
spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters. "We discourage such trips
by high-ranking US officials."


Asked whether the White House viewed Pelosi's visit as a mere
"photo opportunity," Perino replied: "I believe that Assad thinks
of it that way and he tries to use it as leverage."


The United States accuses Syria of fuelling unrest in Lebanon to
undermine the government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora and of
letting foreign fighters slip through its border on their way to
target US-led forces in Iraq.


"We believe that Syria knows exactly what it needs to do," said
Perino.


The spokeswoman also defended herself from charges that she
assailed Pelosi's planned visit last week on the very day that
some of US President George W. Bush's Republican allies were in
Damascus meeting with Assad.


"We discouraged it (the Republican visit). When I was asked last
week I was only asked about Speaker Pelosi," she said.


Pelosi's office refused to say when the speaker -- next in line
for the presidency behind Vice President Dick Cheney -- would get
to Damascus, citing security worries. But informed sources said
last week that she would meet with Assad on Tuesday.
