Celtic expressed regret on Monday at Paul Telfer's decision to
quit the club before the end of his contract to join his family
in England.


The versatile 35-year-old right-back, who last turned out for the
Scottish champions in last month's Champions League loss to AC
Milan, followed manager Gordon Strachan to Parkhead from
Southampton in 2005.


The club in a statement said: "It is with great regret that
Celtic FC have announced today that Paul Telfer has ended his
contract with Celtic for family reasons.


"Celtic have reluctantly accepted Paul's decision and we fully
respect his request to end his contract with the club."


The nephew of former Scotland and Chelsea midfielder Eamonn
Bannon, who himself has one Scotland cap to his name, leaves the
Hoops with 73 appearances and one goal.
