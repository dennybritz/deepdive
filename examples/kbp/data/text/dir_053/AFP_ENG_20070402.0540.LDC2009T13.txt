Lyon captain Juninho could be out for up to two weeks with a
pulled left buttock muscle, the French champions announced on
Monday.


The 32-year-old former Brazilian international suffered the
injury during the first-half of the 1-0 League Cup final defeat
to Bordeaux on Saturday.


Juninho - who played on but eventually had to go off in the 68th
minute - underwent a scan on Monday which revealed the extent of
the problem.


Juninho - who is in talks about extending his present contract by
two years to 2010 - will miss Saturday's league match with
Valenciennes and is doubtful for the following one against
strugglers Sedan on April 14.


Despite the disappointment of the League Cup loss and exiting the
Champions League Lyon look certain to secure their sixth
successive title as they lead Lens by 16 points and have a game
in hand.
