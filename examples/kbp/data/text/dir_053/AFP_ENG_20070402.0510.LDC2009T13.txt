The embassies of Britain, Germany and Portugal were evacuated
Monday from the building they share in Caracas due to rumors of a
bomb threat against London's mission, the German ambassador said.


"There is an alarm from the British embassy. The building has
been evacuated," German Ambassador Georg Dick told AFP. "There
was a bomb threat call against the embassy of Great Britain, but
there is no official alert."


A British embassy source also confirmed the alarm, but added that
staff were "partially" returning to the offices.


The building, which also houses the Reuters news agency's bureau,
is located in Las Castellana, a residential neighborhood in east
Caracas.
