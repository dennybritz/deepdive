Relegation-threatened Serie A side Messina sacked coach Alberto
Cavasin on Monday and replaced him with his predecessor Bruno
Giordano.


Cavasin - previously in charge of Fiorentina and Lecce - had only
been in the post since January 30 and Sunday's 2-0 defeat to
Cagliari proved the last straw.


Under Cavasin they had garnered just eight points from the eight
matches he was in charge for and are presently third from bottom.


Last season Messina finished in the relegation zone but stayed up
due to Juventus' demotion for match-fixing.
