Women soldiers from the British Army took on guard duty at two of
Queen Elizabeth II's residences -- Buckingham Palace and Windsor
Castle -- for the first time Monday, the army said.


At Buckingham Palace, in London, the famous changing of the guard
-- to which hundreds of tourists flock each day -- saw a female
officer, Captain Chloe Madden of the Army Air Corps, make history
by mounting the Queen's Guard.


"It is believed it is the first time a female officer has been a
participant in the Queen's Guard mount at Buckingham Palace," the
army said in a statement.


Meanwhile, at Windsor Castle -- the queen's weekend home --
female squaddies were on guard Monday for the first time in
nearly 1,000 years.


A team of 20 soldiers, including five women, from the King's
Troop Royal Horse Artillery, will be on duty at the castle, just
west of London, for the whole of this month.


To mark the start of their assignment, the troops, wearing plumed
hats and braided tunics, marched into the castle led by a brass
band and watched by dozens of tourists.


"We're confident that women have not guarded the castle before,"
a spokesman for the regiment said.


"Ninety-nine percent of guards are done by foot guards battalions
which are completely male-organised."


Buckingham Palace became a royal residence in 1761, while Windsor
Castle is the largest and oldest occupied castle in the world --
the site it is built on was chosen by William the Conqueror in
the 1070s.
