Eleven people people were killed and another 12 injured by a
speeding bus as they waited on a pavement for transport to a
wedding in northern India Monday, police said.


"The accident happened when the bus lost control," police
spokesman Manish Awasthi told AFP in Lucknow, capital of Uttar
Pradesh state.


The victims were on their way to attend a wedding ceremony, the
official said.


The accident took place in Ambedkar Nagar town, 200 kilometres
(125 miles) southeast of Lucknow.


Four of the injured were in a critical condition.


Road accidents are common in India due to bad roads, overloaded
public transport and reckless driving.
