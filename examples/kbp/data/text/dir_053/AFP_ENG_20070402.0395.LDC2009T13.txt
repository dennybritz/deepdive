An avalanche wiped out eight children and their mother and killed
another man when it buried houses in a village in eastern
Tajikistan, the country's emergencies committee said Monday.


"An enormous avalanche hit the house of a large family, killing
seven children and their 44-year-old mother" in the village of
Kazoktary, 300 kilometres (190 miles) east of Dushanbe, a
spokesman said.


The avalanche also killed a 17-year-old man as he was walking
down a mountain road and destroyed three other houses in the
village, the spokesman said.


Avalanches are common in the mountainous central Asian country,
killing dozens of people every year and causing damage worth tens
of millions of euros.
