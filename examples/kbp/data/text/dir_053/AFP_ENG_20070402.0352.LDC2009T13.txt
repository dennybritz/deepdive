Oman Air said on Monday it has signed a letter of intent to buy
five Airbus A330-200s to expand its current fleet of 10 mostly
Boeing aircraft.


Oman Air CEO Ziyad Karim al-Haremi told AFP the airline had sent
the letter of intent to the European manufacturer to buy the five
aircraft.


The carrier "expects to buy several aircraft and has already
negotiated the purchase of five Airbus A330-200s, with the first
for delivery in 2009" if a final contract is signed, Haremi said.


At current prices of 165 million dollars per aircraft, the deal
would be worth 825 million dollars to the European planemaker.


The Omani national airline was established in 1993 and flies to
11 international destinations with its 10-strong fleet of six
Boeing 737 jets and four ATR 42-500 turbo-prop aircraft.


Oman Air envisages adding new destinations "to contribute to
tourism development in the sultanate," Haremi said of the carrier
which is 34 percent government- owned.
