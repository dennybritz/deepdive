National Football League officials have decided to cancel a pre-
season game planned for August in China with hopes of putting a
game in Beijing after the 2008 Olympics, Sports Illustrated
reported.


On its website, the magazine reported that the league will
announce in the next few days that the game planned in Beijing
between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will be
called off, citing unnamed sources.


The report cited two primary reasons for the move - the effort
being undertaken ahead of a regular-season game being staged in
London in October and the desire to debut at Olympic Stadium, now
under construction in Beijing.


The NFL game was originally planned to be a one-year ahead test
event for the Olympics in Beijing. Owners Paul Allen of the
Seahawks and Bob Kraft of the Patriots hoped the game would boost
their business ventures in China.


Miami and the New York Giants will meet October 28 in London in
the first regular-season NFL game played outside North America.
