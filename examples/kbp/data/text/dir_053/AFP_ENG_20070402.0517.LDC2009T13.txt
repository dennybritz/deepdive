The White House on Monday defended calling the 15 British sailors
and marines held by Iran "hostages" and denied ramping up
rhetoric towards Tehran to set the stage for war.


"We reject any notion that suggests that we are ratcheting up the
language in terms of trying to prepare to go to war with Iran.
That is certainly not the case," said spokeswoman Dana Perino.


US President George W. Bush "believes that the Brits have shown
that the sailors were in Iraqi waters and that they need to be
returned immediately and unconditionally," Perino told reporters.


Asked about the decision to label the sailors "hostages" rather
than "captives," Perino explained: "They were doing nothing
wrong. They were summarily plucked out of the water and are being
held.


"So the president believes that's appropriate language," she
said.


Bush on Saturday said Iran's seizure 15 British sailors and
marines was "inexcusable behavior" and he opposed any "quid pro
quos" to get them back.


"It's a serious issue because the Iranians took these people out
of Iraqi waters," Bush told reporters at the presidential Camp
David retreat just outside Washington.


"And it's inexcusable behavior and I strongly support the
(British Prime Minister Tony) Blair government's attempts to
resolve this peacefully," Bush said after talks with Brazilian
President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva.
