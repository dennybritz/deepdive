Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko on Monday ordered the
dissolution of parliament and fresh elections in a televised
speech, as thousands of protesters vowed to defy his decision.


"Today I signed the decree interrupting the parliament's powers
before term," Yushchenko said, adding that "this is not only my
right, it is my duty."
