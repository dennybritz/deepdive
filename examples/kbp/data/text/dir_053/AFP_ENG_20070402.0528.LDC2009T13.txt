Spanish builder Acciona and Italy's Enel will "very soon" launch
a bid for Endesa after German's E.ON dropped its bid for the
Spanish utility, a spokeswoman for Acciona said Monday.


"There is no date for the moment but it will be very soon," she
told AFP.


Enel and Acciona together own 46 percent of Endesa, Spain's
largest power group.


E.ON had offered 40 euros a share for Endesa, which would value
the company at around 42 billion euros (56.4 billion dollars).


But Enel and Acciona had said they were willing to offer at least
41 euros a share, an offer that values the Spanish company at
43.4 billion euros.
