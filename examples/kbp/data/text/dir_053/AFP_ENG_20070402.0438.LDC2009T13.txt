West Indies' World Cup miseries multiplied on Monday when match
referee Jeff Crowe handed the hosts a fine for their slow over-
rate during their 113-run defeat against Sri Lanka.


International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Crowe imposed
the fines after Brian Lara's side was ruled two overs short of
its target at the scheduled finish of the Sri Lanka innings at
the National Stadium on Sunday, said an ICC statement.


Sri Lanka scored a healthy 303-5 in their stipulated 50 overs
after a 45-minute delayed start due to rain. West Indies were
bowled out for 190.


"In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct over-rate penalties,
players are fined five per cent of their match fees for every
over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the
captain fined double that amount," said the ICC statement.


As such, Lara has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee while
his players have each received 10 per cent fines.


West Indies have now suffered three defeats in as many matches in
the Super Eights following their 103-run mauling by Australia and
seven-wicket thrashing of New Zealand.


West Indies, champions of the first two World Cups in 1975 and
1979, now have to win all their remaining three matches to have
any hope of sneaking into the last four.


Pakistan and India - both out of the World Cup after first round
- were the first two sides to be fined for slow over rates in the
tournament.
