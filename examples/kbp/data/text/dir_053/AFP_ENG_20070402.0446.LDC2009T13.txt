US Vice President Dick Cheney warned Monday that the United
States faces defeat in Iraq if Democrats succeed in imposing a
timetable for the withdrawal of US forces.


"It's time the self-appointed strategists on Capitol Hill
understood a very simple concept: You cannot win a war if you
tell the enemy you're going to quit," Cheney said in remarks
prepared for delivery at a political fundraiser.


Democrats, who control Congress for the first time since US
President George W. Bush took office, have passed emergency
funding for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but inserted
language requiring a pull-out of US forces from Iraq in 2008 at
the latest.


"When members of Congress speak not of victory but of time
limits, deadlines, or other arbitrary measures, they're telling
the enemy to simply watch the clock and wait us out," Cheney
charged.


Bush has vowed to veto any timetable, and the Democrats lack the
votes needed to override him but have vowed not to back down in
the fight over the unpopular war.


"It is pointless for the Democrats to continue pursuing this
legislation," Cheney was to say in Alabama. "It's time for
Congress to stop the political theater and send the president a
bill he can sign into law."
