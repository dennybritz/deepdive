Peruvian President Alan Garcia ordered the interior minister
Monday to use warplanes to strike drug trafficking installations
in Peru's Amazon region.


"We have to finish with the last (coca) processing facility, the
last clandestine airport," Garcia told Interior Minister Luis
Alva Castro. "Use A-37 airplanes. Bombard, machine gun these
airports and processing facilities."
