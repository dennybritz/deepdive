Canada's commercial seal hunt kicked off Monday with the aim of
harvesting 270,000 harp seals, but only a few boats left port in
search of prey, officials said.


The hunt "opened today" in traditional seal breeding grounds in
the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, fisheries department spokesman
Phil Jenkins told AFP.


"To our knowledge, there are a couple of vessels out there. But
we have not yet heard of any sealing activity," he said, noting
that "seals are scarce" there this season because of poor ice
conditions.


Up to 20 percent of the Atlantic herd usually nests on thick ice
floes in the southern Gulf, but this year authorities and animal
rights groups found only slush and ice fragments too small to
support a newborn pup.


Ice floes in the northern Gulf and around Newfoundland province,
where hunting can begin in April 4, remain in good condition.


In the past three years, one million harp seals have been killed
in the commercial hunt in eastern Canada.


Demonstrators in Europe and Canada have denounced the "cruelty"
of seal hunting.


But Ottawa maintains the hunt poses no threat to the seal
population, which has ballooned over the past three decades to
almost 5.5 million.
