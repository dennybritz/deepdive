Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson faces a defensive
headache after it was confirmed Monday that Nemanja Vidic will be
sidelined for five weeks with a broken collarbone.


The Serbia international fell awkwardly in the first half of
United's 4-1 win over Blackburn, and his absence leaves Ferguson
needing to reshuffle his defence for Wednesday's Champions League
quarter-final first leg clash with AS Roma.


United were already without injured pair Mikael Silvestre and
Gary Neville before Saturday's latest setback.


Wes Brown, who had been deputising for Neville at right-back,
switched to central defence to partner Rio Ferdinand when Vidic
was injured against Blackburn.


Ferguson may choose the same option in Rome or he could move
Gabriel Heinze from left-back to partner Ferdinand at the heart
of the United defence and utilise O'Shea or Patrice Evra at left-
back.
