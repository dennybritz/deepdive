Ulisses Morais resigned as coach of Portuguese First Division
club Maritimo on Monday because of a series of poor results.


Morais, who had been in charge of the club since the 2005/06
season, took the decision because the club had fallen out of the
spots for European competition next term.


However the board did not agree with his decision according to a
statement from the club.


Morais, who took over after being sacked by Gil Vicente, had been
hired with the objective to keep Maritimo above the relegation
zone.


Maritimo are presently ninth, 24 points adrift of leaders FC
Porto.
