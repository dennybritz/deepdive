Egypt has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to
launch an enquiry into claims made in a documentary that Israeli
troops executed Egyptian prisoners during the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war.


"Egypt has officially requested the ICRC to launch an enquiry
into the matter of the prisoners and to hand over relevant
documents," State Minister for Legislative Affairs Mufid Shehab
told parliament on Monday.


Israeli public television in February broadcast a documentary on
Israel's Shaked commando in which it said 250 Egyptian PoWs were
killed by the unit in the El- Arish area of the Sinai peninsula
during the 1967 Six Day War.


However, the director of the film subsequently said he had
mistakenly identified Palestinian fighters who were killed in
combat as Egyptian prisoners.


The ICRC representative in Cairo, Gerard Peytrignet, confirmed to
AFP that Egypt had asked for documents over a week ago, but he
could not comment on the request for an enquiry.


"We have been approached by the Egyptian authorities to supply
information in our possession concerning the 1967 war,"
Peytrignet said, adding that the request had been passed on to
headquarters in Geneva.


He said it would take "some time" to retrieve the necessary
information from the archives.


The ICRC in Geneva was not immediately available for comment.
