The Czech Republic must pay 25.4 million euros (33.9 million
dollars) in compensation to the Dutch-based joint venture Eastern
Sugar following an arbitration ruling over its sugar production
quota, the finance ministry announced on Monday.


The company, jointly owned by British-based sugar giant Tate
& Lyle and German-based SuedZucker, initially demanded
compensation of 109 million euros, ministry spokesman Ondrej
Jakob said.


"We were successful in 70 percent of our defence," Jakob said.


"The ministry of finance is currently analysing this arbitration
decision. Its next steps will be taken after consultation with
its legal representation," he added.


Eastern Sugar claimed it was short changed by the Czech
government when its 2003 sugar quota was cut by 30 percent while
other producers were awarded increases.


Eastern Sugar announced last October that it would close three
Czech refineries and transfer their production quotas to other EU
states in response to the EU's moves to reform its support system
for locally produced sugar.


The Czech Republic will this year lose around 22 percent of its
annual sugar beet production quota and be transformed into a net
importer of sugar, according to local beet producers.
