Kumar Sangakkara believes Sri Lanka's variety could prove key to
an assault on the World Cup.


The colourful wicket-keeper/batsman, who stumped Brian Lara in
the crushing 113-run win over the West Indies on Sunday, says
that if one part of the squad misfires, another will perform
instead.


"One of the great things about our side is that we have a variety
and balance," said Sangakkara.


"We've got three different types of fast bowlers, four different
kinds of spinners and then when it comes to the batters we have
variety there as well.


"Sanath (Jayasuriya) at the top, workers in the middle and then
guys who can finish off with a bang at the end. It's something
we're excited about but just because you have it doesn't mean it
works all the time.


"It takes a lot of hard work, a lot of focus and if the guys are
hungry enough, I think we can go far."


Despite failing with the bat on Sunday, Sangakkara played a vital
role in the field.


He surprised Lara by smartly stumping the West Indies captain for
just two off left arm seamer Chaminda Vaas before getting rid of
the dangerous Ramnaresh Sarwan in the same way.


"It is always disappointing not to get runs because I pride
myself on that ability so it's time I pulled up my socks and made
a proper contribution because I haven't done much in the past
three games," admitted Sangakkara.


"That is something I will be working on in practice and I am
looking forward to doing that.


"But it was a good day for me behind the stumps again. The hard
work in practice pays off."
