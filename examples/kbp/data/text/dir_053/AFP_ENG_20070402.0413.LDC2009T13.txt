A UN human rights expert warned Monday that police officers and
soldiers in Zimbabwe who obey orders to shoot demonstrators could
face prosecution for crimes against humanity.


"The Zimbabwe government must immediately halt its use of lethal
force against unarmed political activists," the UN Special
Rapporteur on extrajudicial or summary executions, Philip Alston,
said in a statement.


Alston underlined that military or police officers were only
legally entitled to kill in self-defence or to defend another
person's life.


"Under international law, widespread or systematic attacks
against the civilian population are crimes against humanity," he
said.


"Members of the police and military who comply with orders to gun
down demonstrators will eventually be held to account," Alston
added.


The UN expert called for a full and independent investigation
into the killing of at least 11 people who were either shot at
point blank range or beaten to death, saying the cases were
"particularly troubling".


"The government is, in effect, instructing its forces to shoot
innocent people, in complete disregard for the right to life,"
Alston added.


Thousands of Zimbabwean workers are expected to take part in a
general strike this week, as pressure mounts on President Robert
Mugabe's regime over its violent crackdown on political opponents
and the country's economic meltdown.
