An American citizen has been missing in southern Iran for several
weeks, the US State Department confirmed Monday.


The US national, who has not been identified, was "in Iran on
private business," spokesman Sean McCormack said, adding that
neither his employer nor his family had heard from him for
"several weeks."


The United States on Monday called on Iran to investigate the
man's disappearance, passing a message via Swiss officials,
McCormack said.


Washington and Tehran broke off diplomatic ties 27 years ago and
US interests in Iran are conducted via Switzerland.


Earlier the CNN television network reported the American was
believed to be working for an independent media producer trying
to set up interviews when he went missing on Kish Island, a free-
trade zone under Iranian authority off its southern coast.
