Suspected Islamic militants on Monday attacked a private radio
station in Nigeria's largest northern city,  vandalising its
transmitter, officials of the radio said.


The protesters, armed with batons and knives, hurled stones at
Freedom Radio for broadcasting at the weekend what they
considered as conflicting views on the Eid-el Maloud, the Islamic
festival marking the birthday of Prophet Mohammed, the radio
production manager, Abdulrahman Nuraini, told AFP.


"Policemen stationed within the premises of the radio prevented
the protesters from gaining entry. But they made for the
tranmitter and set it ablaze," he told an AFP correspondent who
visited the scene, littered with stones.


The radio allegedly gave airtime on Saturday to an Islamic cleric
whose views on Eid-El Maloud were believed by a group of Muslims
to have cast doubt on whether it was right to mark the festival.


"We can read a political meaning into this action. The group came
on Sunday on a peaceful protest. We pacified them after they
presented their letter of protest. Suddenly today (Monday) they
came in their hundreds to destroy our radio station," he stated.


There was an attempt by unidentified persons two months ago to
burn down the radio station, established in December 2003.


The radio, the first privately-owned in northern Nigeria, belongs
to Bashir Dalhatu, a lawyer and former minister of mines power
under the late General Sani Abacha.
