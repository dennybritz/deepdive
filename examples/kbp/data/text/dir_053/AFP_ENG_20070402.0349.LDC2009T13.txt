Growth cooled in March in the US factory sector in line with
slower overall economic activity, the Institute of Supply
Management said Monday.


The ISM said its index of national industrial activity dipped to
50.9 percent from 52.3 percent in February.


Any reading over 50 indicates expansion, so the report suggests
the sector is growing at a modest pace.


The figure was roughly in line with the average Wall Street
estimate of 51 percent.


Norbert Ore, the ISM survey chief, said the ISM index at current
levels "corresponds to a 2.8 percent increase in real gross
domestic product (GDP) annually."


The sub-indexes in the survey were mixed.


ISM's new orders index was 51.6 percent in March, down 3.3
percentage points from February and the production index fell 1.1
points to 53 percent.


The employment index fell to 48.7 percent, down 2.4 percentage
points, suggesting jobs are being reduced.


Manufacturers' inventories contracted for the eighth consecutive
month in March but the the inventories index registered 47.5
percent, a 2.9 percentage point increase.


The price index surged meanwhile to 66.5 percent from 59 percent,
suggesting increased price pressures for some commodities.
