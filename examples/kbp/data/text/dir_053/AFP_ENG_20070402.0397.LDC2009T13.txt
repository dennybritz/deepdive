The South Asian regional grouping SAARC has given preliminary
approval for Iran to be granted observer status, India's foreign
secretary said Monday, despite objections from Western powers.


"The SAARC council of ministers recommended the acceptance of the
application from Iran for observer status," Indian Foreign
Secretary Shivshankar Menon, without saying when the application
could be approved.


The South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation is made up of
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka, and Afghanistan will be inducted into the bloc at a two-
day summit in New Delhi beginning Tuesday.


Observers of the grouping include China, the European Union,
Japan, South Korea and the United States. The US will be
represented by its assistant Secretary of State for South and
Central Asia Richard A. Boucher.


Tensions between Tehran and the West are running high over its
detention of 15 British naval personnel, with relations already
strained over Iran's refusal to halt nuclear enrichment.


Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Western diplomat said the
SAARC bloc was "well aware that now is the wrong time to give
carrots to Iran" and that this would be communicated to its
members.
