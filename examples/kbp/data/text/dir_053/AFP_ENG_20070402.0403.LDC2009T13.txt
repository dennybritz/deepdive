AZ Alkmaar coach Louis van Gaal has extended his club contract
through until 2010 with a get-out clause if a national side come
calling for the World Cup in that year.


According to the ANP news agency, van Gaal will be able to break
his Alkmaar deal "only in the case that Germany, England, Spain,
Argentina or the Netherlands call him up as coach".


"If I were to quit AZ before 2010, it would only be for a team
that has a chance of winning the World Cup in South Africa," said
van Gaal, who was approached recently by the Australians but
turned them down.


Van Gaal coached Barcelona in two spells from 1997 to 2000, and
2002 to 2003, with time as the Dutch national coach in between.


He was also the boss of Ajax for a decade between 1987 and 1997,
during which time they won the 1995 Champions League title.


Alkmaar are presently third in the championship race, five points
adrift of leaders PSV Eindhoven, and face Werder Bremen in the
UEFA Cup quarter-finals first leg on Thursday.
