Unions at the French plants of European aircraft manufacturer
Airbus have called a half-day strike for Tuesday in protest at
the group's controversial restructuring plan.


The CGT and Force Ouvriere unions said they had called on workers
to down tools from 09:00 am to 1:00 pm (0700 GMT to 1100 GMT) on
Tuesday, the eve of a meeting of the company's European works
council.


Under the Power8 restructuring plan announced by Airbus at the
end of February, the group is to axe 10,000 jobs across Europe,
with the aim of saving 5.0 billion euros (6.6 billion dollars) by
2010.


"We are treating (the works council) with caution and we intend
to keep up the pressure," Force Ouvriere's representative on the
works council Jean-Francois Knepper told AFP.


"The management will present the financial situation of Airbus
and EADS as well as the ramping up of Power8," Knepper told AFP.


On March 6 some 15,000 Airbus workers protested in Toulouse,
where Airbus is headquartered, along with 2,000 at each of the
plants at Nantes, Saint Nazaire and Meaulte.


Ten days later, mass demonstrations took place in northern
Germany, southern Spain and in France in a rare show of cross-
border union activism against the restructuring plan which
management says is vital to rescuing Airbus.


Union voices have warned of much tougher action to come, down to
the halting of production lines, if Airbus and parent company
EADS did not back down on their plan.
