Russia wants to conduct new joint inspections with the European
Union at Polish meatworks before lifting an embargo, the head of
Moscow's veterinary and food safety services said Monday.


"The documents provided by the European Commission to resolve the
problem are inadequate, that's why we are proposing that the
European Commission carry out new joint inspections at the Polish
plants," Sergei Dankvert told news agency Interfax.


Russia imposed an embargo on the meat of EU member Poland in
November 2005, accusing the Polish authorities of fraud in the
implementation of food safety standards.


Poland argues that Moscow is playing politics because of
differences with the conservative government in Warsaw, and
blocked last November the launch of EU- Russia talks on a broad
economic cooperation agreement.


In Brussels, a European Commission health affairs spokesman said
Russia had all the information it needed and that no new
inspections were necessary.


"The Commission gave an exhaustive answer to the Russian
authorities last Thursday addressing all the questions that were
raised," said the spokesman, Philip Tod.


He also suggested that Dankvert's remarks might not be Moscow's
final word.


"The Russian authorities themselves said they would need a week
to examine" the documents, Tod said. "They only got them on
Friday, that's not a week yet."


The German EU presidency said Friday that it hoped to resolve the
problem before the next EU-Russia summit in Samara, eastern
Russia on May 18.
