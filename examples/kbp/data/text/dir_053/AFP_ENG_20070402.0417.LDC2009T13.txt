Spain's High Court on Monday rejected an appeal by builder
Acciona and its Italian partner Enel to have a temporary ban
against their proposed counterbid for utility Endesa removed.


Spanish stock market regulator CNMV has ruled that the two firms
must wait six months from the end of the acceptance period for
German utility E.ON's bid for Endesa on Tuesday before they could
launch their own bid.


Enel and Acciona, which together own 46 percent of Endesa, said
on Thursday that they would appeal the ruling.


E.ON has offered 40 euros a share for Endesa, which would value
the company at around 42 billion euros (56.4 billion dollars).


But Enel and Acciona have proposed at least 41 euros a share, an
offer that values the Spanish company at 43.4 billion euros.


The same court on Friday rejected a complaint filed by E.ON
against the stock market regulator's decision to allow Acciona
and Enel to bid for Endesa six months after the German utility's
offer expires.
