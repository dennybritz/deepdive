Russian world number two Maria Sharapova has pulled out of next
week's WTA event the Family Circle Cup and the forthcoming Fed
Cup clash in Moscow with Spain, it was announced on Monday.


Sharapova is slated to miss between five to six weeks of action
because of a repeat of a right shoulder injury and a left
hamstring injury.


"I am very disappointed to have to withdraw from the Family
Circle Cup because of my injuries that will keep me out for five
to six weeks," said Sharapova, who was recently ousted as world
number one by Justine Henin.


"I'm looking forward to getting back on the court as soon as
possible," added Sharapova.


Sharapova was clearly not at here best last week when she was
demolished 6-1, 6-1 by Serena Williams - who had also beaten her
in the Australian Open final - in the last 16 of the Miami ATP
and WTA Masters Series event.
