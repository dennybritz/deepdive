A woman and a man were found shot dead Monday on the floor of a
University of Washington building in the US northwest in a
possible murder-suicide involving an instructor, police said.


The bodies were found after gun shots rang out on the fourth
floor of the architecture department's Gould Hall building at the
school's Seattle campus in the morning, police said.


"A man and a woman, both in their 30s, (were found) dead on the
floor," Ray Wittmier, the university's assistant police chief,
told AFP. "A weapon was found nearby. One of the victims is
believed to be an instructor."


He added that the shooting might have been a murder-suicide but
that it was still under investigation. He had no further details.


Dozens of students were evacuated from Gould Hall and were kept
at bay by police, television images showed.
