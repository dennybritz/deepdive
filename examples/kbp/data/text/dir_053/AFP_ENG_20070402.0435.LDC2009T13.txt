Slovenian veterinary authorities said on Monday additional
testing confirmed that a seven-year-old cow slaughtered last
month in the country was infected with mad cow disease.


"Testing carried out at the National Veterinary Institute
confirmed the cow was infected with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE)," a statement issued by the Slovenian
veterinary office said.


The diseased cow was born and bred in a small farm near the town
of Celje, 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of the capital
Ljubljana.


"The farm where the diseased cow was bred remains isolated and no
movement of cattle is allowed," the office said, adding that two
descendents of the diseased cow were still alive and would have
to be killed.


The case is the seventh detected in a Slovenian-born cow. Another
cow in which BSE was diagnosed had been imported.


The first case of BSE was deteced in the European Union member
country in 2001.
