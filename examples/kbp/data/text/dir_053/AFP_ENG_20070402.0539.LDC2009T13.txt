Valencia striker David Villa says his side is feeling confident
ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against English
champions Chelsea in London on Wednesday after a weekend win in
the Spanish league.


"We are all in high spirits after winning on Saturday," the
Spanish international told a press conference.


Valencia got a boost to their morale ahead of their trip by
winning for the first time in four outings on Saturday, a hard-
fought 3-2 win over Barcelona- based Espanyol.


"Scoring a goal away from home and not losing would give many
options. I am sure the tie won't be decided over there and we can
return with a result that helps us," he added.


"Chelsea is not the same team that it was in the beginning of the
era of (Chelsea chairman Roman) Abramovich and it is going
through some problems in its league but we are aware that they
are one of the best teams in the world."
