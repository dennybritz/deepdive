New car registrations in Spain fell by 0.4 percent in March on a
12-month basis to 173,491 units as higher interest rates
continued to soften consumer demand, the country's car
manufacturers' association Anfac said Monday.


Since the beginning of the year 410,534 new cars have been
registered in Spain, a 0.7 percent decrease over the same time in
2006, it said in a statement posted on its Internet site.


Citroen led registrations during the first three months of the
year with 40,453 units, followed by Renault with 38,380 units and
Ford with 37,781 units registered.


Spain's car manufacturers' association predicts 1.6 million
vehicles will be registered in 2007, a 2.0 percent decline over
the previous year.
