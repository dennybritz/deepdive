Qatar is close to buying into the European Aeronautics Defence
and Space Company (EADS) which makes Airbus planes, the Qatari
foreign minister said on Monday.


"There are serious talks to reach a general agreement," Sheikh
Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani said at the opening of a
construction exhibition.


"We have almost reached an understanding regarding the
purchase... There are a few points that need to be agreed upon
before the deal is signed."


Qatar officials have reportedly said they are considering
acquiring 10 percent of EADS.


The troubled company has been hit by delays with its A380
superjumbo project, order cancellations and abrupt management
changes in the last 12 months.


It now faces employee disaffection and a battle with trade unions
over cutbacks that management says are urgently needed.
