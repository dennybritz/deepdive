A former mining town in northern Canada became the country's
first municipality to ban single-use plastic bags Monday, as
trash talk mounts nationally.


Leaf Rapids, with only 539 residents and three retail stores,
imposed the ban to reduce its garbage heap and tidy up the
surrounding wilderness for tourists, town administrator Bond Ryan
told AFP.


"Leaf Rapids is built in the middle of a boreal forest; it's very
green. We wanted to take the bags out of our environment because
they were blowing around town and sticking to trees," he said.
"It was unsightly."


The remote fishing town is about 900 kilometers (550 miles) north
of Winnipeg, in western Canada.


Ryan estimated 50,000 fewer plastic bags would end up in its
landfill each year, as a result of the bylaw. Stores that
continue to distribute the bags meanwhile face a hefty fine of
1,000 Canadian dollars (865 US).


"We're the first to ban plastic bags, but I think it will catch
on across the country soon," Ryan commented. "Canada is ready for
it."


Indeed, the southeastern British Columbia town of Rossland is
considering a similar ordinance.


And a deluge of newspaper articles beseeched others to follow
suit after San Francisco became the first US city to outlaw
plastic grocery bags last month.
