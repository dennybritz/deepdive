Mozambique experts on Monday began deactivating thousands of
explosive devices collected by the military more than 10 days
after massive explosions at an arms depot killed 119 people.


"Four thousand unexploded devices have been collected and their
destruction began today at Moamba" about 60 kilometres (40 miles)
southwest of the capital Maputo, defence ministry spokesman
Joaquim Mataruca told AFP.


Bombs, mines and ammunition exploded in the country's largest
arms depot near Maputo international airport on March 22 with
debris falling on nearby poor neighbourhoods, triggering fires
and causing panic. About 500 people have been reported injured.


The armoury was built in the 1980s by the Soviet Union during
civil war in the former Portuguese colony in southeast Africa.


The latest death toll of 119, up two on a previous toll, was
given by Maputo city hall on Monday.


Municipal council president Eneas Comiche said that "nearly 800
houses were partially or totally destroyed" in the disaster.


Seven hundred and fifty families needed assistance after the
blasts, according to Casimiro Abreu, the government's emergency
aid coordinator.


"They received food, tents and equipment to be able to survive
until their situation has become clear," he added.
