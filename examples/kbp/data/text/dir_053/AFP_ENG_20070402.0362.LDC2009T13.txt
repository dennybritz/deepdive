The 30,000 "surge" US troops sent as reinforcements to Iraq will
remain in the war-torn country until at least the end of August,
a US Defense Department spokesman said Monday.


The Pentagon has decided to deploy 7,000 troops to replace units
on their way out of Iraq, a move that will allow the
reinforcements to remain in Iraq until at least late August,
spokesman Bryan Whitman said.


President George W. Bush announced the troop "surge" in January
in a new security effort to bring down sectarian violence in
Baghdad and the restive Al- Anbar province.
