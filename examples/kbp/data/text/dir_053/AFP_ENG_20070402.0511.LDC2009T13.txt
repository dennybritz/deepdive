Veteran former Portuguese international defender Fernando Couto
received a four month suspended prison sentence here on Monday
for failing a drugs test back in 2001.


The 37-year-old - who was also fined 4000 euros - tested positive
for nandrolone following a Serie A match between Fiorentina and
his then club Lazio in January 2001.


Couto, who is still playing in Serie A with strugglers Parma,
fell foul of the Italian anti-doping law which was implemented in
2000 and is one of the strictest in the world, with prison
sentences ranging from three months to three years.


The 110-times capped Couto, who has always protested his
innocence, was suspended by the sports authorities for 10 months,
though that was reduced to four months on appeal.


Couto, who has won the now defunct Cup Winners Cup with Barcelona
and Lazio and the UEFA Cup with Parma in 1995, is not the first
athlete to be prosecuted for such offences but none have gone to
jail.
