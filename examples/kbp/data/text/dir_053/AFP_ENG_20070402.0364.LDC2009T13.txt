A Vincent Van Gogh exhibition at the Budapest Fine Arts Museum
has broken all visitor records since the country's transition
from communism in 1989, a museum spokesman said Monday.


The exhibition of works by the Dutch master attracted around
483,000 visitors in four months, including nearly 10,000 --
another record -- on Sunday, the last day, spokesman Zoltan Levay
said.


The show ran from December 1 to April 1. It featured 77 works by
the Dutch artist from 1881 to 1890, including 43 paintings, 24
drawings and 10 lithographs or engravings.


The works on show included "Vase with Blue Irises," "Village
Street in Auvers" and "L'Arlesienne: Madame Ginoux with Gloves
and Umbrella."


The works were on loan from more than 40 collections, including
those of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Musee d'Orsay in
Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
