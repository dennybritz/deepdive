A new Ivory Coast peace accord that binds the west African
nation's two warring factions to implementing it will ensure it
succeeds where others have failed, Burkina Faso's foreign
minister said Monday.


Youssouf Ouedraogo expressed his confidence to reporters that the
agreement would be implemented after a meeting with his South
African counterpart, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.


"People who are fighting with arms are the right people to sign a
peace agreement.  We have taken account of other agreements that
have been signed on Cote d'Ivoire," he said.


"We believe that because the two sides in the conflict agreed to
sign it, it will solve more than 90 percent of the problem."


Dlamini Zuma also emphasised the importance of having the two
rivals sign the agreement.


"The important thing about this agreement is that its signed by
the two belligerents and it commits them to implementing it," she
said.


"Since these are the two who have the forces... there is no one
better placed to implement that agreement."


The accord signed last month is aimed at preventing fighting
between government and rebel forces, more than four years after a
coup attempt split the cocoa-rich country in two.


As part of the agreement, President Laurent Gbagbo last week
named arch-rival rebel leader Guillaume Soro as prime minister.


Ouedraogo and Dlamini Zuma welcomed Soro's appointment and "urged
all Ivorian parties to remain committed to the implementation of
the agreement.
