The International Red Cross will send 53,000 dollars (40,000
euros) to the Solomon Islands Red Cross in the wake of Monday's
tsunami that struck the Pacific islands over the weekend.


The money will go towards damage assessments, the purchase and
shipping of relief supplies, said the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in a statement.


It comes from the organisation's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund.


At least fifteen people were killed after a powerful undersea
earthquake unleashed a tsunami that hit the western Solomon
Islands, destroying entire villages.


The wall of water triggered by the 8.0-magnitude quake -- which
witnesses said was up to five metres (16.5 feet) high -- swamped
towns, flattened homes, and sparked panic among residents of the
impoverished South Pacific state.


The US Geological Survey reported aftershocks measuring up to 6.7
throughout Monday, including a tremor of 6.0 at 6:50 pm (0750
GMT). Geophysicists warned that more large earthquakes could be
expected in the coming days.


Across the Pacific, governments from Australia to New Caledonia
evacuated schools and urged coastal residents to move to higher
ground, but no damage was reported.
