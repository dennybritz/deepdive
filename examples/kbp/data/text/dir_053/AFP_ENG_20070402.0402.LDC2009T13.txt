Peruvian President Alan Garcia ordered the interior minister
Monday to use warplanes to strike drug trafficking installations
in Peru's Amazon region.


"We have to finish with the last (coca) processing facility, the
last clandestine airport," Garcia told Interior Minister Luis
Alva Castro. "Use A-37 airplanes. Bombard, machine gun these
airports and processing facilities."


He warned that if Peru does not "kill the drug trafficking danger
now," it could face "an insurgency like the one of a brother
country."


Garcia was referring to Colombia, where the government is
battling leftist guerrillas that use the illicit drug trade to
finance their insurgency.


"We must asphyxiate cocaine production," he said, adding it was
the best way to make coca leaf farmers plant alternative crops
such as cafe, cocoa. "You make less money but you live legally."
