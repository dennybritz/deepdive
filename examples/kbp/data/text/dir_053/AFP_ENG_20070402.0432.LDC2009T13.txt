A British soldier died Monday after being wounded on patrol in
the southern city of Basra, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.


The soldier was hurt in the Al Ashar district and died of his
injuries later.


The death brings to 136 the number of British soldiers killed in
Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003.


It is the second British fatality in two days -- another soldier
died Sunday in the same area and in similar circumstances.


"We can confirm that a British soldier has been killed and a
further injured in a small arms fire attack whilst on a routine
patrol in the Al Ashar district of central Basra at about 1700
hours local time, the MoD said in a statement.


Earlier Monday, military spokesman Major David Gell told AFP that
a soldier had been shot and wounded near Basra palace, one of the
British military bases in the city.


Around 7,200 British soldiers are in Iraq, mostly in the second
city of Basra and surrounding areas of southern Iraq, though
Prime Minister Tony Blair announced in February that their number
would be cut by 1,600 within a few months.


But Blair also said British troops would stay around Basra into
2008 to help Iraqi forces in a support role "for as long as we
are wanted and have a job to do."
