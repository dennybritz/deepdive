One in seven of London's full-time workers earn less than what
the British capital's mayor, Ken Livingstone, deems to be the
minimum wage necessary to survive on in the city, he said Monday.


And almost half of part-time workers earn below the benchmark, he
added.


"It is simply unacceptable," Livingstone said.


The mayor announced that his new "London Living Wage" figure was
7.20 pounds (14.25 dollars, 10.65 euros) per hour -- well above
the 5.35-pound national minimum wage for workers aged over 22.


"The London Living Wage is vital to ensure the capital retains a
skilled, committed workforce and this applies to those who
provide all the essential services -- without which London would
grind to a halt -- as much as it does to highly-paid brokers,
bankers or lawyers," Livingstone said.


A report published by the mayor's office said anyone earning less
than 6.25 an hour was at or below the poverty level in London,
due to the high cost of housing.


An extra 15 percent was then added on to make it a "truly living
wage."


"Hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers struggle to survive
and raise their families in London, one of the most expensive
cities in the world," said Steve Hart, regional secretary of the
Transport and General Workers' Union.


"It is the minimum that responsible employers should be paying to
keep their workforce out of poverty."


The mayor has no powers to compel employers to up their wages for
employees at the lower end of the pay scale.
