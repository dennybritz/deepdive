The US Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Environmental
Protection Agency was wrong to refuse to consider greenhouse
gases as pollutants, in a blow to the Bush administration.


"Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act's
capacious definition of 'air pollutant' we hold that EPA has the
statutory authority to regulate the emission of such gases from
new motor vehicles," the court ruled.


Led by Massachusetts, a dozen states along with several US cities
and environmental groups went to the courts to determine whether
the agency had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide emissions.
