German energy group E.ON said on Monday that it was withdrawing
its takeover bid for Spanish power company Endesa, but still
hoped to buy assets from the group worth about 10 billion euros
(13 billion dollars).


E.ON made the announcement after reaching an agreement with
Endesa's two main stakeholders, Acciona and Enel.


"Today, E.ON signed an agreement with Enel and Acciona in order
to put an end to the substantial uncertainty surrounding the
takeover bid for Endesa," the company said in a statement.


"Therefore, E.ON will not carry out the takeover bid designed to
acquire a majority stake in Endesa."
