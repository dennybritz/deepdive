Nigeria, Africa's largest oil producer and the world's six
largest, will on Tuesday announce the date for the 2007 bid round
for oil blocs, officials said on Monday.


"The energy minister (Edmund Daukoru), will tomorrow (Tuesday)
announce the date and detailed procedure for the 2007 bid round
for oil blocs," spokesman for the state-run oil firm Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Levi Ajuonuma, told AFP.


The announcement will likely indicate the number of blocs to be
put on auction and their locations, officials said.


Bidding for the sale of Nigeria's offshore oil blocs has been
suspended several times last year.
