Manchester United director and former playing legend Bobby
Charlton has denounced speculation over Cristiano Ronaldo's
future as incorrect and destabilising for the star winger.


Both Barcelona and Real Madrid have been linked to the 22-year-
old Portugal international whose dazzling form has helped
United's push towards prising the Premiership title away from
Chelsea.


Charlton told BBC Radio on Monday: "They link themselves to
whoever they feel fit and it's not right.


"I don't think it's a correct way to go about their business."


Charlton is confident Ronaldo will reject the overtures from
Spain and sign an extension to his existing contract which would
keep him at Old Trafford until 2012.


"I can see no reason at all why he should want to play for
another club.


"It's really destabilising for both the club and the player to
have all this speculation about his future. All of it is coming
from abroad and none from our club."


Ronaldo - who had seemed to be on his way out of the club
following adverse headlines after team-mate Wayne Rooney's
sending-off in the World Cup quarter- final between Portugal and
England - confirmed last month that he was ready to thrash out a
new deal with United.
