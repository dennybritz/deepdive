Israeli soldiers entered the Gaza Strip and clashed with
militants on Wednesday, the first major incursion into the
territory since a November ceasefire, Palestinian security
sources said.


Soldiers moved into farmland east of the northern Gaza village of
Beit Hanun, sparking sporadic gunfights with militants and
injuring one Palestinian, the sources said.
