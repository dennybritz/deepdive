AFP was still without news of Iraqi employee Salah Jali al-
Gharrawi on Wednesday, a year after he was kidnapped at gunpoint
in Baghdad on his way home from work.


Neither AFP nor Gharrawi's family have received any claim of
responsibility and have no information on who kidnapped the AFP
office manager and accountant, who is the father of five
children.


Iraqi authorities, US-led forces and foreign embassies have all
been contacted by AFP and have promised assistance, but so far
have not uncovered any leads.


Various journalists' unions, organisations defending the rights
of correspondents and reporters, including former hostages in
Iraq, have also demanded Gharrawi's release.


He was abducted by gunmen in two cars, including a sports utility
vehicle with tinted windows, on the evening of April 4 after
leaving the AFP bureau in Baghdad.


His wife Bushra al-Gharrawi has regularly visited the capital's
morgues but has never found her husband's body nor given up hope
of one day seeing him alive again.
