Hong Kong share prices closed sharply higher Wednesday, gaining
1.03 percent, in a holiday-shortened week, with property stocks
leading gains on expectations of strong housing sales during the
five-day break from Thursday, dealers said.


They said sentiment was generally boosted by strong gains on the
US and Japanese bourses, although ICBC bucked the trend after its
2006 net profit came in below expectations.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 207.01 points at
20,209.71.
