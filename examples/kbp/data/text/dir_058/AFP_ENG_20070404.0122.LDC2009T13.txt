Spanish industrial production rose by 3.5 percent in February
from the same month a year earlier, seasonally corrected figures
released Wednesday by the National Statistics Institute (INE)
showed.


Consumer goods output expanded by 3.7 percent while capital goods
production was up 9.5 percent on the year, the INE said.


The Spanish economy was one of the strongest in Europe last year,
growing by 3.9 percent. The government estimates that it will
expand by at least 3.5 percent in 2007.
