Finland's Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said on Wednesday that
negotiations to form a new centre-right coalition government were
underway following his party's narrow victory in last month's
elections.


"The parliamentary group of the Finnish Centre Party, the
parliamentary group of the National Coalition Party, Green
Parliamentary group and the Swedish Parliamentary Group have
decided to continue the negotiations to form a new government,"
Vanhanen told a press conference.


Vanhanen's Centre Party emerged from the March 18 elections with
just a one seat advantage over the conservative opposition which
will have 51 seats in the Finnish parliament.


If the parties agree to form a new government Vanhanen will lead
a centre-right coalition, a new direction for Finland, after four
years under a centre-left government.


Official negotiations on forming the next government begin on
April 11 and will last four to five days. President Tarja Halonen
will name the new government on April 19.
