China is one of the world's top users of electronic plane
tickets, but the rest of Asia Pacific is on the same uptake level
as Africa, the International Air Transport Association (IATA)
chief said Wednesday.


"China is the top performer on e-ticketing. At 95 percent, it is
well ahead of the global average of 78 percent," IATA director-
general Giovanni Bisignani said.


"The rest of the Asia Pacific is a disappointment. At 68 percent,
it is (on) the same level as Africa. This is largely because of a
slow uptake in Japan, the region's biggest market, and a slow
start in Malaysia," he said at an industry event here.


Bisignani said Asia needs to use technology, including
"biometric" passports, to ease movement because by 2010, airports
in the region will have to handle 250 million more passengers
that it currently deals with.


"Building infrastructure is a costly part of the solution. We
need effective systems to get passengers through the system, and
technology can help," he said.
