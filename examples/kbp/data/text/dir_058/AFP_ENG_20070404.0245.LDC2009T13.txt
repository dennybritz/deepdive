German steel makers will enjoy another two years of booming
business this year and next, the RWI economic research institute
predicted on Wednesday.


But with German steel plants already operating at more than 90
percent of capacity, only a small increase in output is possible
this year from record levels reported in 2006, the think-tank
said in a statement.


Last year, a total 47.2 million tonnes of steel was produced in
Germany, a rise of 6.3 percent year-on-year and the highest level
since reunification in 1990.


RWI forecast that worldwide steel output would expand by 6.0
percent in 2007 and by 4.6 percent in 2008.
