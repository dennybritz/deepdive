After lengthy study US regulators announced they are leaving in
place a ban on cell phone use aboard airplanes, saying research
remained inadequate to overturn the ban.


In a statement published on its website Tuesday, the Federal
Communication Commission said it would no longer consider lifting
the ban on in-flight use of cell phones and other portable
electronic devices (PEDs), which regulators fear could interfere
with aircraft navigation and communication systems.


Research carried out since the government telecommunications
regulator began reconsidering the ban in December 2004 provided
"insufficient technical information on whether the use of
cellular phones on board aircraft may cause harmful interference
to terrestrial networks," it said.


"Further, because airlines, manufacturers, and wireless providers
are still researching the use of cell phones and other PEDs
onboard aircraft, the FCC found that it would be premature to
seek further comment at this juncture."


Many US aircraft passengers express frustration at not being able
to use their cell phones and other devices in-flight.


However, others oppose lifting the ban, saying they would be
disturbed by other passengers loudly chatting away on the phones
while in the air.


The FCC said it might reexamine the issue "if appropriate
technical data is available."
