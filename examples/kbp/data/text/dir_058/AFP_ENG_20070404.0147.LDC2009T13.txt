Wall Street and other major bourses are expected to guide Hong
Kong's stock market next week, in another trading week shortened
by public holidays, analysts said.


Housing data from the United States will also weigh heavily on
the bourse, which will be closed from Thursday for the Chinese
Ching Ming festival and for Easter. Trading will resume on
Tuesday.


"If Wall Street and other major markets perform well during the
days when the local bourse is closed, we can well expect today's
gains to be sustained on Tuesday when the market reopens,"
Celestial Asia's Eugene Law said.


"Sentiment remains positive and follow-through buying can be
expected if there are positive overseas leads," Law said.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended the week at 20,209.71,
gaining 207.01 points on Wednesday alone. For the week to April
4, the index gained 408.78 points or 2.06 percent.


The market will also get a significant boost if apartment sales
during the five- day break turn out as strong as expected, Law
said.


He noted, however, that some investors are likely to continue
taking a wait-and- see stance for more clues on the state of the
US housing market and subprime mortgage lenders there.
