The average price of crude oil will fall to 54 dollars per barrel
in 2008, Indonesia's energy minister said Wednesday.


The fall will dent oil revenue in the country, southeast Asia's
only member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro
said.


Yusgiantoro said oil revenue would drop to 99.8 trillion rupiah
(10.9 billion dollars) next year from 119.98 trillion in 2007.


The revenue estimates assume an average price of 63 dollars per
barrel this year, and that Indonesia's average oil output will
rise to 1.1 million barrels per day in 2008 from 1.05 million
this year.


The country has become a net oil importer in recent years despite
its membership of OPEC.


The oil price has rallied in the past few days because of tension
in the Middle East after Iran detained 15 British naval
personnel.
