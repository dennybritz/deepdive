British Airways topped a list of European airlines with the worst
record for losing passengers' baggage published by an aviation
consumer watchdog Wednesday.


BA lost 23.0 bags per 1,000 travellers, compared with 21.0 for
TAP Air Portugal in second place, 18.1 for Lufthansa in third,
16.6 for Air France in fourth and 16.5 for Alitalia in fifth.


The average figure for 2006 was 15.7 per 1,000 passengers and a
total of 5.6 million mishandled bags.


The figures, complied using data from airlines themselves, come
from Britain's Air Transport Users Council (AUC), and only
feature members of the Association of European Airlines (AEA).


Some big name airlines are not featured on the list at all
because of a lack of data -- six AEA airlines, including Virgin
Atlantic, did not provide statistics on lost baggage, while low-
cost airlines like Ryanair and easyJet are not members of the
group.


"Instances of mishandled baggage can cause considerable stress,
inconvenience and expense," the AUC said in a statement.


"They also show that passengers often struggle to get reasonable
redress from airlines after the event."


The organisation also said that airlines should be named and
shamed in league tables, suggesting that the European Commission
could organise the statistics.


The AEA claims that airlines return 85 percent of lost bags to
passengers within 48 hours, but that leaves nearly a million bags
a year which take longer than that, the AUC said.
