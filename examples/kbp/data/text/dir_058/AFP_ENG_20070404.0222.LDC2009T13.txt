The United States promised Wednesday to help Russia complete its
push for World Trade Organisation membership before a crucial
election cycle opens at the end of the year.


"We believe we can be of great help to our Russian partners" in
concluding the multilateral WTO agreement that is the final step
to joining, US Trade Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said after a
Moscow meeting with Russian counterpart German Gref.


To reach that step, Moscow needs to iron out agricultural and
intellectual property agreements with the United States, conclude
bilateral deals with four more countries, and resolve a trade
dispute with neighbouring Georgia.


"It is critically important to complete all talks this year and
enter the next political cycle already a member of the WTO," Gref
said, referring to Russia's upcoming parliamentary poll in
December and presidential election in March 2008, when President
Vladimir Putin is due to step down.


Russia is the largest world economy not yet a member of the
150-member world trade body.
