German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom declined to
comment Wednesday on reports it might bid for a 66-percent stake
in Olimpia, the holding company for Pirelli's 18-percent stake in
Telecom Italia.


"We do not comment on market rumours," a Deutsche Telekom
spokesman said.


Italian newspapers had reported earlier that Deutsche Telekom
might team up with Mediobanca and Assicurazioni Generali in a
joint bid for the Olimpia stake, which is also coveted by US
telecom group AT&T and its Mexican affiliate, America Movil.


Pirelli is in exclusive talks to sell two thirds of Olimpia to
the American and Mexican companies by April 30.
