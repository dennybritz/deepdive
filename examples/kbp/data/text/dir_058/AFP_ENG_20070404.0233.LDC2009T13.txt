The French foreign ministry on Wednesday said a French historian
and expert on Islam was being held against his will in Iran and
called on Tehran to allow him to leave.


Stephane Dudoignon, who works for the National Center for
Scientific Research (CNRS), was detained on January 30 during a
trip to the southeastern Sistan- Baluchestan province, bordering
Pakistan and Afghanistan.


"We call on Iranian authorities to quickly find a solution
allowing Mr Dudoignon to leave Iranian territory," said foreign
ministry spokesman Denis Simonneau.


No charges have been laid against him, but his passport has been
taken from him, said the foreign ministry.


Dudoignon's case was raised with Iranian ambassador Ali Ahani,
who was called into the foreign ministry last week to also hear
about French concerns over the detention of 15 British sailors.


Iran captured the 15 navy and marines personnel on March 23,
accusing them of trespassing into its territorial waters. Britain
insists they were on a routine patrol in Iraqi waters.


France has called on Iran to release the sailors and expressed
its "solidarity" with Britain over the detention.


Le Monde newspaper reported that Dudoignon, who is married to an
Iranian, was being held under de facto house arrest in Tehran
while authorities were investigating the reasons for his trip to
the sensitive area.


Dudoignon was arrested near Chabahar while taking photographs in
the street of a religious procession, the foreign ministry said.


Le Monde reported that foreign ministry officials had hoped to
resolve the case quietly through diplomatic channels.
