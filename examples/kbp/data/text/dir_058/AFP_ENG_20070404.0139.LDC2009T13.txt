Hong Kong share prices closed sharply higher Wednesday, gaining
1.03 percent in a holiday-shortened week, with property stocks
leading gains on expectations of strong housing sales during the
five-day break from Thursday, dealers said.


They said sentiment was generally boosted by strong gains on the
US and Japanese bourses, although ICBC bucked the trend after its
2006 net profit came in below expectations.


The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 207.01 points at
20,209.71 after moving in the range of 20,099.85 and 20,210.84.
For the week, the index gained 408.78 points or 2.06 percent.
Turnover was 51.68 billion Hong Kong dollars (6.6 billion US
dollars).


"The property sector paced today's rally because April and May
are traditionally the peak of sales of new and second-hand
apartments.


"Many investors expect robust sales of apartments during the the
long Easter holiday weekend," said Eugene Law, head of research
at Celestial Asia Securities Holdings.


The market will be closed from Thursday until Monday for the
Ching Ming Festival and Easter.


"Interest in properties was also bolstered by market talk that
the US Federal Reserve might cut interest rates sometime at the
end of the second quarter or in the third quarter of this year,"
Law said.


"Sentiment has been sound in the past few days and the strong
gains in the Tokyo market today encouraged investors to buy
stocks across the board despite the long holiday weekend," he
said.
