Syria is mediating between Iran and Britain over the British
sailors detained by Tehran 13 days ago, Syrian Foreign Minister
Walid Muallem was quoted as saying on Wednesday.


"We hope that a satisfactory solution will be reached for the 15
British sailors taken prisoner in Iran," Muallem told Kuwait's
Al-Anbaa newspaper.


"Such a solution requires quiet diplomacy and Syria is
undertaking such diplomacy between the two countries," he said.


Muallem said he did not beleive that the crisis over the sailors
would result in a joint US-British military strike against Iran.
