Israeli soldiers entered the Gaza Strip and clashed with
militants on Wednesday, the first incursion into the territory
since a November ceasefire, Palestinian security sources said.


Soldiers driving five tanks, bulldozers and jeeps, penetrated
half a kilometre into farmland near the northern Gaza village of
Beit Hanun, sparking sporadic gunfights with militants, the
sources said.


Two Palestinians were injured, one of whom was subsequently
arrested by Israel, according to the sources.


The first incursion by ground troops into the Gaza Strip since a
November 26 ceasefire follows a call by Israeli Defence Minister
Amir Peretz for the army to take "decisive action" against Gaza
militants to halt the firing of homemade rockets into the Jewish
state.


On March 28, Israel launched a first strike against Palestinians
firing rockets from the northern Gaza Strip after a four-month
hiatus the November ceasefire. No soldiers entered Gaza during
that strike.


A handful of senior Israeli intelligence and military officials
have warned in recent weeks that Gaza's militants are rearming
themselves with weapons smuggled from Egypt and called for
military action.
