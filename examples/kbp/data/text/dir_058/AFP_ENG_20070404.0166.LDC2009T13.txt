UN police in East Timor said they fired warning shots in the
capital Dili after being injured Wednesday during unrest near the
Australian Embassy just days before the country's presidential
poll.


"The officers brought the situation under control by firing two
warning shots," the force said in a statement.


They received minor injuries when they came across people
fighting with rocks, it said.


They mobilised after reports said roadblocks had been set up near
the embassy, but none was found.


The force said that five people were injured in a separate
incident near Dili involving supporters of rival candidates
standing in East Timor's presidential poll next week.


It described both episodes as significant security incidents.


The presidential election is the first in the troubled and
impoverished country since it declared independence in 2002,
following more than two decades of occupation by nearby
Indonesia.
