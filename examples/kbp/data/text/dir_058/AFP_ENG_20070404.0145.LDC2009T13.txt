Two men were shot dead Wednesday in Thailand's restive south,
police said, amid growing sectarian tension due to an Islamic
separatist insurgency.


Two Muslim villagers aged 49 and 76 were killed when four men in
a pick-up truck opened fire on a house in Narathiwat, one of
three southern provinces beset by separatist violence.


More than 2,000 people have died in the Muslim-majority region
bordering Malaysia since the insurgency began in January 2004.


The violence has worsened since a coup last year, despite a
series of peace initiatives by the army-installed government.


Police usually blame Islamic insurgents for the attacks, although
analysts believe the violence to be more complicated.


Muslims with perceived links to the government are often
targetted for attack, although Buddhists in the region feel
increasingly vulnerable.


Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog, last month accused
the Thai military of being behind forced disappearances here, a
claim army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont has denied.
