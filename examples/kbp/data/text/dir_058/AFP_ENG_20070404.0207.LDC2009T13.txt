Two Lebanese hostages abducted in southern Nigeria on Saturday
have been freed, a Scottish oil company whose employee was also
released told AFP on Wednesday.


A spokesperson for Dolphin Drilling had earlier confirmed the
release in Nigeria of its British employee Gordon Gray and a
Dutch oil worker.


"He was released along with a Dutch national and two Lebanese
hostages who had been kidnapped as well," the spokesperson said.
The Dutchman and Lebanese pair were not employed by Dolphin
Drilling.
