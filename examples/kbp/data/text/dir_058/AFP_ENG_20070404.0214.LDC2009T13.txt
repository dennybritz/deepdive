Poland has given "indications" that it could lift its veto on
opening talks between EU and Russia on a partnership pact,
European Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger said
Wednesday.


"The Commission has indeed received indications from the Polish
authorities that Poland is in a position to give its agreement to
the launching of negotiations," Laitenberger told journalists.


He added that Polish support would be "a supplementary
contribution to a global ... solution of the open questions
between the European Union and Russia."


For the last four months, Warsaw has vetoed opening talks between
the European Union and Russia on a new partnership agreement
because of a Russian ban on Polish meat and other food products.


Russia imposed the embargo in December 2005, accusing Polish
authorities of fraud in the implementation of food safety
standards.


But Poland argues that Moscow is playing politics because of
differences with the conservative government in Warsaw.


The European Commission has been trying to convince Russian
authorities to lift the ban, and the German EU presidency has
said it hoped to resolve the problem before the next EU-Russia
summit in Samara, eastern Russia on May 18.


In Warsaw, Polish President Lech Kaczynski told reporters: "We
will lift our veto when we have guarantees that the embargo will
be lifted."


He did not elaborate.


Kaczynski also said he would discuss the issue later Wednesday
with Poland's prime minister, his twin brother Jaroslaw.
