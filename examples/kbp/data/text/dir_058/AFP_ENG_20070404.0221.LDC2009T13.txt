The French foreign ministry on Wednesday said a French historian
and expert on Islam was being held against his will in Iran and
called on Tehran to allow him to leave.


Stephane Dudoignon, who works for the National Center for
Scientific Research (CNRS), was detained on January 30 during a
trip to the southeastern Sistan- Baluchestan province, bordering
Pakistan and Afghanistan.


"We call on Iranian authorities to quickly find a solution
allowing Mr Dudoignon to leave Iranian territory," said foreign
ministry spokesman Denis Simonneau.
