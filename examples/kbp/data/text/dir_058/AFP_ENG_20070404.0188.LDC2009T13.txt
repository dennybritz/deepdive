Werder Bremen's German international midfielder Torsten Frings
revealed Wednesday that he is considering a move to Italian
outfit Juventus.


"Juve want me at all costs. They don't want me to be just another
midfielder but 'the' playmaker," the 30-year-old Frings told the
daily Bild.


"I'm thinking a lot about this idea."


Werder Bremen sporting director Klaus Allofs said he was
surprised by the news. "We're not going to put ourselves under
pressure. If Torsten no longer wants to play for Werder I'm not
going to force him," said Allofs.


"We have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent.
We're not dependant on one player, Werder is more important than
any player."


Juventus are on course for promotion to the Serie A after being
demoted last summer and given a nine-point handicap for their
role in the Italian match- fixing scandal.


Capped 66 times for Germany, Frings signed from Bayern Munich in
2005 and is under contract until 2009. He played for Borussia
Dortmund from 2002-2004.


He is not the only Bremen player considering his options with
striker Miroslav Klose, whose contract runs until 2008, yet to
accept his new deal.


Werder, who achieved the Bundesliga and Cup double in 2004, are
currently second in the league two points behind leaders Schalke
04.
