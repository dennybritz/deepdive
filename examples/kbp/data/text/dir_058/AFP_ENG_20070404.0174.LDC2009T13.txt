For the first time in more than half a century, Paris' Louvre
museum has ordered a series of contemporary works for permanent
display from artists Anselm Kiefer, Cy Twombly, Francois Morellet
and Luciano Fabro.


The works "will renew a tradition of ordering art for the decor",
Louvre director Henri Loyrette said at a press conference
Tuesday, recalling that the last work commissioned by the Louvre
was Georges Braque's 1953 ceiling of the Henri II gallery.


German artist Kiefer's canvas -- a 10x4 metre (30x12 foot) on
constellations and funeral rites -- will go up in October this
year by the side of the northern stairs in the Egyptian
Antiquities department.


A canvas by Twombly, stained-glass by Morellet and an as yet
undefined work by Fabro will by hung by 2010, Loyrette said.
