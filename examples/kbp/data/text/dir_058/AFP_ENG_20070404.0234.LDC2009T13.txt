The disputed Caucasus region of Nagorny Karabakh will hold
presidential elections on July 19, a spokesman for the regional
parliament said Wednesday.


"Presidential elections are required 50 days before the end of
the current head of state's term," parliamentary spokesman Mikael
Hajian told AFP.


President Arkady Gukasian, elected in 1997 and 2002, is
constitutionally barred from running for a third term.


Armenian forces seized Nagorny Karabakh from Azerbaijan during a
war in the early 1990s that claimed an estimated 35,000 lives and
forced about a million people on both sides to flee their homes.


A ceasefire was signed in 1994, but the two countries have cut
direct economic and transport links and failed to negotiate a
settlement on the status of the enclave.
