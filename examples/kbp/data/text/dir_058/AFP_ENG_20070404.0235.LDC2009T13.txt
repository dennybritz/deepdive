US private equity firm Carlyle Group has met "some difficulties"
as it tries to win government approval to invest in China's
Chongqing City Commercial Bank, the Chinese lender said
Wednesday.


Carlyle has yet to convince Chinese regulators that it meets the
regulatory requirements for foreign investment in domestic banks,
an official with the Chongqing bank said.


"As far as I know, they've encountered some difficulties," Li
Zaining, a senior official with Chongqing Bank's investment told
AFP.


"The banking regulatory body is still going through the review
process and Carlyle needs to submit more documents."


He said one of the problems is that foreign investors hoping to
buy into Chinese banks must submit audited reports for the past
three years, but the Carlyle fund applying for the investment was
established only in 2005.


Under a deal announced in December, Carlyle will pay 80.7 million
yuan (10.4 million dollars) for a 7.99 percent stake in the bank.


In the same agreement, Hong Kong's Dah Sing Bank will buy 17
percent of Chongqing Commercial for 171.7 million yuan (22
million dollars).


Chongqing Bank told AFP on Monday that the government had agreed
to the stake sale to Dah Sing Bank.
