A Briton and a Dutch national held hostage in volatile oil-rich
southern Nigeria have been released, the British High Commission
and an industry source said Wednesday.


"I can certainly say the Briton has been released," a spokesman
for the British High Commission told AFP.


Meanwhile, an industry source and a member of a militant group
both said a Dutch expatriate worker was also released.


Since the start of this year, about 60 foreigners have been
kidnapped in southern Nigeria, as many as were abducted during
the whole of 2006.


The foreigners, most of whom have been released unharmed, were
seized by a mixture of criminal gangs out to make ransom money
and armed groups with a political agenda.
