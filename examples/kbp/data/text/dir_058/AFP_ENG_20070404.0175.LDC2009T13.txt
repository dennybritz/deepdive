Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer said Wednesday it will
invest 40 million US dollars this year to support its growing
presence in the Asia Pacific region.


The investment will go to improving the company's spare parts
supply and distribution system as well as a state-of-the-art
training facility that will include a flight simulator.


Operations of the flight simulator will start in June and
technical and flight attendant training will begin in 2008, it
said in a statement.


"Asia is an extremely important region for Embraer. Recent sales
have demonstrated that the market here is well suited to our
products," Embraer's executive vice president for airline market
Frederico Fleury Curado said.


Embraer's specialist jets are designed specifically to serve
markets needing an aircraft with 70 to 110 seats.
