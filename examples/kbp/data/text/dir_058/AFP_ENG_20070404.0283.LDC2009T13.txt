Under-fire Greg Chappell has resigned as India's cricket coach
following the team's first round exit from the World Cup, sources
told AFP on Wednesday.


Chappell, 58, sent an e-mail to Indian cricket board president
Sharad Pawar, saying he did not wish to renew his contract as
coach for "family and personal reasons," the sources said.


The former Australian captain has served as coach since June 2005
and his two- year contract was due to end on May 31.
