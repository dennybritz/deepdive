Indian filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, director of the Bollywood
mega-hit "Devdas", is to stage an opera in Paris next year, the
Theatre du Chatelet said on Wednesday.


From March 14 to 24, Bhansali will present six performances of
"Padmavati", an rarely-performed opera-ballet written in 1923 by
French composer Albert Roussel and inspired by Indian legend.


Leading a mainly-French cast, Marie-Nicole Lemieux from the
French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec will play the title
role of a woman who falls prey to a vile bargain, in a lyrical
tale set in 13th-century India.


Bhansali's 2002 movie "Devdas" -- a tragic musical tale of two
childhood sweethearts whose love is thwarted by their families --
was the most expensive Hindi film ever made, reaping
international success and a host of awards.


The Theatre du Chatelet -- Paris' second largest opera house --
will also host an adaptation of David Cronenberg's science-
fiction hit "The Fly" -- brought to the stage by the director in
partnership with Spain's tenor Placido Domingo.
