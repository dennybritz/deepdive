The United States wants Bangladesh to set a date for elections,
the US embassy in Dhaka said Wednesday.


An embassy spokesman said US Ambassador Patricia Butenis had made
the call after visiting the new election commission chief on
Tuesday evening.


"I, of course, emphasised the desirability of issuing a timeline
for the election," the ambassador told reporters of her meeting.


"People want to know when the election is likely to be held," she
said.


Bangladesh has been ruled by a military-backed interim government
since the president imposed a state of emergency on January 11
and cancelled elections scheduled for January 22.


The new government has vowed to clean up politics before
declaring a new date for elections.


New election officials have been appointed and promised to enact
tough new voting laws and carry out sweeping reforms.


But they have set no date for the polls.


On Monday, army chief general Moeen U Ahmed called for a new
brand of democracy for Bangladesh, saying the country's
experience with parliamentary democracy in the last 16 years had
bred corruption and crime.


At least 45 prominent figures, including the son of outgoing
prime minister Khaleda Zia, have been arrested or detained on
charges of corruption.
