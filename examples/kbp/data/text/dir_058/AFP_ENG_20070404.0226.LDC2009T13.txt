Sevilla medical staff hope that the club's star striker Fredi
Kanoute can survive until the end of the season without an
operation on his persistent groin problem, the club said here on
Wednesday.


Kanoute, the Spanish first division's leading scorer with 19
goals, has struggled to find his top form in recent games and has
been rested where possible in a bid to ease or help cure the mild
strain.


"After studying all the parameters of this case, we've concluded
that the treatment Kanoute is currently undergoing will permit
him to finish the season without having to be operated upon,"
said Sevilla club doctor Adolfo Munoz.


Munoz did not comment on whether he believes the French-born
Malian international will have to undergo surgery in the summer.


Kanoute's groin problems have been compounded by the fact that
Sevilla are still contesting three titles and they need his
prowess in front of goal.


Sevilla are currently second in the Spanish first division, two
points behind leaders Barcelona.


They have also reached the semi-finals of the Spanish Cup and
face English Premiership side Tottenham Hotspur in a UEFA Cup
quarter-final first leg tie on Thursday.
