Wakefield's England stand-off Jamie Rooney is set to make an
early return from injury, the Super League joint leaders
confirmed Wednesday.


Rooney has been cleared to face Bradford on Monday and could even
play at Huddersfield this Friday after making a speedy recovery
from a torn calf muscle picked up in the Wildcats' win over
Warrington ten days ago.


"He's an even-money chance for Friday and a certainty for
Monday," said coach John Kear.


"The physio has done a great job with him but he is a very
determined kid. Because he's so important to us, we are going to
give him as long as he wants."
