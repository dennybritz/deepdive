Pakistan's highest court ordered an inquiry Wednesday into the
alleged manhandling of a government lawyer during protests
against the dismissal of the country's chief justice, officials
said.


The incident allegedly happened on Tuesday when 2,000 lawyers and
opposition activists rallied outside the Supreme Court, where a
panel of senior judges was hearing misconduct charges against
Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.


Khalid Ranjha, one of the lawyers leading the government's case
against Chaudhry, said a group of people "used abusive language
and attempted to assault him and other members of the team
physically" as they left the court.


Acting chief justice Rana Bhagwandas had directed the registrar
of the Supreme Court to "hold an immediate inquiry into the
matter" after Ranjha lodged a complaint, a court spokesman said.


The inquiry adds to the legal tangle surrounding President Pervez
Musharraf's dismissal of Chaudhry on March 9. The move has
sparked a wave of protests and international expressions of
concern.


The Supreme Court is also hearing an inquiry into allegations
that the Islamabad police chief and other officers manhandled
Justice Chaudhry during his first appearance before the panel of
judges on March 15.


The case against Chaudhry -- who denies allegations of getting a
senior police job for his son and misusing state vehicles -- is
due to resume on April 13.
