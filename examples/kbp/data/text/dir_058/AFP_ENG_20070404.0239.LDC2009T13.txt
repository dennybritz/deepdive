Workers at the US company charged with putting up campaign
posters in voting stations for France's upcoming presidential
elections were on strike Wednesday demanding higher wages, unions
said.


Several of Clear Channel's sites across France were hit by the
strike that began Monday, with unions demanding 200 euros (267
dollars) extra a month for those earning less than 1,600 euros.


About a million posters, one large and one small for each of the
12 presidential candidates, are due to go up from next Monday in
France's 85,000 polling booths ahead of the elections whose first
round is on April 22.


Clear Channel is the world's top outdoor advertising company.
