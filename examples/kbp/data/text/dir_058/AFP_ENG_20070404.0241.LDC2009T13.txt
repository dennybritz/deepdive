Greece will introduce tougher sports legislation on over 200 fan
clubs with most suspected of having links to hooliganism, a
government spokesman said on Thursday.


The measure, due to be introduced after Orthodox Easter on April
8, comes in response to the death of a 25-year-old fan last week
in a pitched hooligan battle ahead of a women's volleyball match
outside Athens.


"This means that 270 fan clubs across Greece will be disbanded
(until the new legislation takes effect)," government spokesman
Theodoros Roussopoulos said after a cabinet meeting on the issue.


"Most of these clubs were proven to have acted as nests of
violence, both inside and outside stadia," he said.


The Greek government last week decided to suspend all team sport
matches for two weeks as a result of the fan's death, an incident
casting doubt on measures taken against the violence that has
plagued sport in the country for decades.


So far a mix of tougher laws and closer cooperation with major
clubs have not solved the problem.
