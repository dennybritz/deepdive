France coach Raymond Domenech voiced concern Wednesday over how
to maintain motivation among Lyon's international players in the
quiet spell between the end of the French league and the next
batch of Euro 2008 qualifiers.


Domenech's last 23-man squad contained nine members of the Lyon
side that is all but assured of capturing a sixth successive
league title.


And the France manager is taking steps to avoid any lack of
motivation between winning the championship and France's Euro
2008 ties against Ukraine on June 2 and Georgia four days later.


"They're going to be crowned champions very quickly and after
that there's a month and a half spell without any ambition.


"It's not easy to keep the players motivated for such a long time
- I'm worried about the risk of lack of ambition.


"It's hard to tell them that they have to remain motivated for a
month and a half while the rest are taking holidays."


He added: "The advantage at Lyon is that we have good relations
with all the technical staff. We'll try to set up a programme to
prepare them.


"I'm going to be going down there to discuss it with them
shortly."


France are lying second in Group B on the same number of points
as surprise group leaders Scotland.
