Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem confirmed on Wednesday that
his country was mediating to seek the release of 15 British
sailors held by Iran after receiving a telephone call from a top
advisor to British Prime Minister Tony Blair.


He said Syria -- Iran's top regional ally -- was exerting "quiet
diplomacy" in a bid to resolve the crisis after the call from
Blair's chief foreign policy advisor Sir Nigel Sheinwald.


"He asked us for our good offices and I contacted the Iranians.
They welcomed our efforts. We are exerting a calm diplomacy,
quietly," he told reporters.


"We are seeking now to enter the direct dialogue between Iran and
Britain."
