Orders placed with companies in the German manufacturing sector
rose sharply in February on the back of an unusually large number
of big-ticket export orders, official data showed on Wednesday.


The Economy Ministry in Berlin calculated that German
manufacturing orders jumped by 3.9 percent in percent in February
from the figure for January, after slipping by 0.3 percent the
previous month.


The ministry attributed the rise to a sharp increase in big-
ticket orders from abroad.


Export orders were up by 6.8 percent in February from January,
while domestic orders rose by a more modest 0.9 percent month-on-
month.


A sector breakdown showed that orders placed with manufacturers
of capital goods shot up by 6.9 percent on a monthly basis in
February.


Orders for manufacturing goods were up by 0.7 percent and orders
for semi- finished goods edged up by 0.8 percent.


Using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations,
German manufacturing orders increased by 1.9 percent in January
and February combined from the figure for November and December,
the ministry said.
