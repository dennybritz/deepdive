Police in central Pakistan said Wednesday they have charged five
Christian men under the country's tough blasphemy laws.


A case was registered against the Christians for disrupting a
procession celebrating the Prophet Mohammed's birthday on Sunday
in Toba Tek Sing district, near Faisalabad city, police official
Aslam Shankar told AFP.


They also allegedly used "inappropriate language," he said.


"We arrested one of them and the other four accused managed to
escape," Shankar added.


Blasphemy is punishable by death under the laws of overwhelmingly
Muslim Pakistan, although no one has ever been executed for the
crime.


Christians, who make up less than three percent of Pakistan's
population of 160 million, say the blasphemy laws are used as an
excuse to victimise them.


In June 2006 two Islamic clerics stabbed to death a Muslim man in
the rural town of Muzaffargarh when police brought him to court
to face blasphemy charges.
