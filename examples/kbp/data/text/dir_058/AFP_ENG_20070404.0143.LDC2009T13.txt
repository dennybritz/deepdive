Direct talks between Iran and Britain late Tuesday to resolve the
sailor row involved top Iranian official Ali Larijani and Prime
Minister Tony Blair's chief foreign policy advisor Sir Nigel
Sheinwald, the IRNA agency reported on Wednesday.


"Nigel Sheinwald, the advisor of Prime Minister Tony Blair had
telephone contact with Ali Larijani," an Iranian official told
IRNA in London.


"This contact took place after Iran expressed its desire to solve
the problem of the arrest of the 15 British sailors and insisted
on the neccessity that London pledges never repeat a violation of
Iranian territory."


Blair's office said on Tuesday that there had been further
contacts between Britain and Iran, including with Larijani, but
did not reveal that an advisor so close to Blair had been
involved.


"On the basis of these (contacts), the prime minister believes
that both sides share a desire for an early resolution of this
issue through direct talks," Downing Street said.
