Poland has given "indications" that it could lift its veto on
opening talks between EU and Russia on a partnership pact,
European Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger said
Wednesday.


"The Commission has indeed received indications from the Polish
authorities that Poland is in a position to give its agreement to
the launching of negotiations," Laitenberger told journalists.


He added that Poland's backing would be "a supplementary
contribution to a global ... solution of the open questions
between the European Union and Russia."


Since November, Warsaw has vetoed opening talks between the
European Union and Russia for a new partnership agreement because
of a Russian ban on Polish meat and other food products.


The Commission has been trying to convince Russian authorities to
lift the ban.
