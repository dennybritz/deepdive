The heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, described as
"crazy" European Union legislation which prevents the sale of
seeds from old vegetable varieties, in an interview released
Wednesday.


Charles, long passionate about environmental issues, also
described how he and his sister, Princess Anne, got hooked on
gardening when they were given a small vegetable patch in the
grounds of Buckingham Palace as youngsters.


His comments came in an interview with a BBC radio gardening show
which he conducted wearing an embroidered long, brown coat
compared by British newspapers to a dressing gown.


"What could be crazier than, I think, having the kind of EU
legislation which made it impossible to sell the seeds of many of
these wonderful old varieties that people have developed over
thousands of years?" he said.


"Hundreds of varieties have been lost -- wonderful things which
our forefathers took enormous trouble to develop and which, in
many cases, are resistant to all sorts of prevalent diseases."


Under EU seeds marketing directives, seeds must meet minimum
quality standards and old varieties fall foul of strict testing
criteria.


Charles also uses the interview -- conducted at his country home
at Highgrove, Gloucestershire, western England -- to talk about
keeping pests off his collection of hostas, a green leafy plant
which is particularly attractive to slugs.
