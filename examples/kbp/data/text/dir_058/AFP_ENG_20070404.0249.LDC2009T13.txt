Britain's Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that conditions in
Sudanese refugee camps were too bad for three Darfuri asylum
seekers to be sent back there, effectively halting all such
removals.


Three judges found that conditions in the camps, near the
Sudanese capital Khartoum, plus a lack of means of economic
support in the area and the potential upheaval to refugees made
their proposed resettlement "unduly harsh".


The court quashed Home Secretary John Reid's decision not to
grant asylum in Britain to three Darfuris in a move which is
likely to affect the cases of up to 1,000 people who have fled
the troubled region to Britain.


One of the judges, Lord Justice Richard Buxton, criticised Reid
for an "unedifying" attempt to argue that conditions in the camps
"are the same or similar elsewhere in Sudan".


He added that the three subsistence farmers involved in the case
-- identified only as AH, IG and NM -- were all victims or
potential victims of persecution by the Arab Janjaweed militia.


Descriptions of living and health conditions in the camps made
"frightening reading", he added.


The judges allowed the three to appeal against a ruling by the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal and refused Reid permission to
appeal to Britain's highest court, the House of Lords.
