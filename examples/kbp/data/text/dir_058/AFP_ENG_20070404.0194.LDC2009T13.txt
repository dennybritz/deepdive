Newcastle winger Tim Visser on Wednesday signed a new two-year
contract that will keep him at Kingston Park until 2009.


The 19-year-old Dutchman, who announced his arrival earlier this
season by scoring the match-winner against Worcester, qualifies
to play for England this September.


Falcons director of rugby John Fletcher said: "Tim is an exciting
talent who has progressed well this season.


"Tim is quick elusive and tough. At 6ft 3in and over 16 stone he
offers the team a real threat in the outside backs."
