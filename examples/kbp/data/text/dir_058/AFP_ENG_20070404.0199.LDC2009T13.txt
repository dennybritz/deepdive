UN police in East Timor fired warning shots after two officers
were injured Wednesday in unrest near the Australian Embassy in
Dili, a statement said ahead of presidential polls next week.


"The officers brought the situation under control by firing two
warning shots," the force said in a statement.


The two officers hurt received their minor injuries when they
came across people fighting with rocks, it said.


They had mobilised to the scene of the unrest in the country's
capital after reports said roadblocks had been set up near the
embassy, but none were found.


The force said that five other people were injured in a separate
incident near Dili involving rival supporters, adding the
injuries were minor and they were taken to hospital.


It described both episodes as significant security incidents, but
it said the situation in around Dili had mostly been calm.


Troubled East Timor holds a presidential election on April 9, its
first since it formally gained independence in 2002.


The force said patrols were increased in the capital on Wednesday
because of election campaigning and that at least 100 were
conducted.


There are fears that unrest could mar the polls, but the
statement said election rallies and meetings held in different
parts of East Timor on Tuesday all passed without incident.


Unrest has pulsed through impoverished East Timor since 1999,
when its people chose self-determination in a UN-administered
referendum.


Last year at least 37 people were killed and 150,000 displaced by
violence that led to the dispatch of Australian-led international
peacekeepers to stabilise the former Portuguese colony.
