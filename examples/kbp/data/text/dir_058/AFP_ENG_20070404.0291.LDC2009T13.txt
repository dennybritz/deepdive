Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday opened a news
conference by launching an attack on the UN Security Council for
failing to prevent bloodshed in the Middle East and Iraq.


"The structure of the United Nations and, in particular, the UN
Security Council, is the result of World War II. The winners
dreamt up these structures to dominate the world," he said in a
lengthy diatribe against the body.


"The right to veto of the United States and Britain mean that
these countries have complete immunity. No country can complain
against these countries at the Security Council."
