A consortium led by Japan's Marubeni Corp. has won an 815
-million-euro (1.09 -billion-dollar) contract for the second
stage of a Turkish undersea rail link between Asia and Europe,
the company said Wednesday.


The consortium, which also includes French engineering group
Alstom and Turkey's Dogus, will construct a railway and set up
power and communications for the tunnel under the Bosporus
(Istanbul) Straits.


Alstom said its share of the contract was worth 323 million
euros.


Turkey hopes that the ambitious project will ease Istanbul's
severe traffic problem.
