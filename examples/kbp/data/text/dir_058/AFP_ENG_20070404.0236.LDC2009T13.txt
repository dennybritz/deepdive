Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is not ready for "serious
negotiations" with the Arabs to find a peaceful solution in the
Middle East, Palestinian foreign minister Ziad Abu Amr said
Wednesday in Vienna.


"I think Prime Minister Olmert is not prepared to take part in
serious negotiations with the Arab side," Abu Amr told a press
conference after meeting with his Austrian counterpart Ursula
Plassnik.


Olmert said this week he was ready to attend an Arab summit to
discuss a revived Saudi-drafted peace plan but has been accused
by the Arab League of seeking normalised ties with the
Palestinian government without making concessions himself.
