US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that Syrian
President Bashar al- Assad had assured her he was ready for peace
talks with Israel.


During her meeting with Assad that has infuriated the White
House, Pelosi said she also raised her "concern" about alleged
support for militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah and infiltrations
into neighbouring Iraq.
