A Malaysian man armed with a knife and a packet of curry powder
has been arrested after stealing a bus and posing as a driver in
order to rob two passengers, police said Wednesday.


The man stole the bus Tuesday in a suburb southwest of Kuala
Lumpur and drove it to a university, ferrying one student around
campus before dropping her off, said district assistant police
commissioner Rosli Mohamad Nizam.


He then picked up two other female students and drove them off
campus, deflecting suspicions when he failed to drop them at
their dormitory by saying he was new to the job.


Off campus, the man stopped and robbed the students at knife-
point.


He also ordered the girls to strip in order to use their clothes
to tie them up, and threatened to toss curry powder in their
faces if they refused.


"If the two girls had not boarded the bus, the other girl would
have been the victim if she did not get off," Rosli told AFP.


"I am very sure he was looking for his prey around there," he
said, referring to the campus.


"Apart from the small knife, he wanted to use the powder and
throw it into the eyes of the victims," said Rosli.


"The powder is very hot, if you get it in your eyes, you go
blind," he added.


The terrified women were rescued after a passing motorist saw
them waving for help from the bus after the hijacker pulled over
at a toll booth to make a phone call.


Police arrived within minutes and chased the man, catching him
after he jumped into a nearby sewage pond.


Rosli said the man, in his 40s, has a criminal record for
extortion, robbery, illegal gambling and sodomy, which is illegal
in Malaysia.
