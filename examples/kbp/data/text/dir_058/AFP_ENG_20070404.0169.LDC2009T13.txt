Forty-four foreign Al-Qaeda militants were killed Wednesday along
with seven Pakistani tribesmen in the worst clashes yet between
the two groups in a restive tribal area, security officials said.


Around 1,000 heavily-armed tribesmen were mounting a final push
against Uzbek, Chechen and Arab bunkers after nearly three weeks
of fighting in the South Waziristan tribal area bordering
Afghanistan, they said.


"Both sides have been using heavy weapons since this morning and
tribal fighters captured important Uzbek bunkers. In the clashes
44 foreigners were killed and seven tribesmen," one security
official told AFP on condition of anonymity.
