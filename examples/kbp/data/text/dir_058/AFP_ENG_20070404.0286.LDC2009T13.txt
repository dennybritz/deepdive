At least seven amateur miners were killed when underground
galleries in a diamond mine in central Democratic Republic of
Congo collapsed, a radio report said Wednesday.


The UN-backed Radio Okapi quoted police as saying that seven
bodies had been brought out but witnesses said dozens of people
were underground when the collapse occurred on Tuesday night.


Kasai Oriental province's governor Alphonse Ngoy Kasanji for his
part told AFP that "for the moment the toll is three dead, but
there are dozens working illegally in those tunnels and it is
very difficult to know how many were there at the time of the
accident and how many were killed."


The vast mine complex at Bakwanga, run by the Miba company, is a
magnet for hundreds of amateur diamond diggers, who operate in
galleries dug by the mine owners then abandoned after the
extraction of stones.
