Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and Northern Ireland's first-
minister-in- waiting Ian Paisley shook hands in public for the
first time on Wednesday when they met in Dublin for informal
talks.


Ahern and Paisley met at an Irish government guesthouse in
Dublin's Phoenix Park as the firebrand Protestant Democratic
Unionist party (DUP) leader prepares to head a power-sharing
administration in Belfast on May 8.


In an accord last month, the DUP and the Catholic Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), agreed to
share power.


Long-time arch foes Paisley and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams held
their first ever face-to-face meeting to clinch the deal but
there was no public handshake.


Paisley had shaken hands with Ahern in private before at
negotiations in St Andrews in Scotland last year, when the Irish
leader presented Paisley and his wife with a bowl carved from a
walnut tree from the site of the 1690 Battle of the Boyne in the
Republic to mark their 50th wedding anniversary.


The Irish government has refurbished the Boyne site north of
Dublin as part of the Northern Ireland peace process.


For generations, "Remember 1690" has been a slogan of Protestant
loyalists in Northern Ireland as it marks the defeat of the
Catholic King James II by the Protestant William III of Orange.
