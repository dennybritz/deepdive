A rare tornado swept Japan's coast Wednesday as the nation was
swamped by rain and hail, causing no injuries but bringing the
beloved cherry blossom season closer to the end, officials said.


The tornado twisted on the Sea of Japan (East Sea) off the coast
of Tottori prefecture, some 700 kilometers (430 miles) southwest
of Tokyo, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.


No casualties or damage were reported, said a prefectural
official.


"It was raining and hailing in the region when the tornado
occurred, but fortunately it was on the water, not on the
ground," he said.


Damaging tornadoes are rare in Japan, although a twister in
November killed nine construction workers on the northern island
of Hokkaido. The Tottori region sees about one tornado a year,
the official said.


Tokyo was also hit by around two hours of intense rain and hail,
drenching the capital with 20 milliliters of rain hitting the
capital, the Meteorological Agency said.


The rain blew off some of the remaining blossoms from cherry
trees, which were already expected to fall by early next week.


Millions of Japanese wine and dine each year at parties under the
cherry trees, enjoying the sight of their delicate but short-
lived blossoms.
