A passenger bus plunged off a cliff south of the Philippine
capital Manila before dawn Wednesday, killing one woman and
seriously injuring 14 other people, police said.


The bus flipped onto its roof after its brakes failed and slammed
into trees before plunging into a 20-metre (65-feet) ravine and
landing upside down, police said.


A 23-year-old female passenger was crushed to death, while 14
others were treated at a nearby hospital. Police did not say how
many were on the bus at the time of the accident.
