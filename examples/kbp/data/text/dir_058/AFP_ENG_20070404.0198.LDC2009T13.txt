A father in Spain was sentenced to three months and three weeks
in prison for hitting his 16-year-old daughter with a slipper, a
court official said on Wednesday.


According to the judgement the man hit his daughter with the
slipper on the arm after she was disrespectful to him when he
told her off for being "inappropriately" dressed in front of the
girl's three-year-old sister.


The blow produced a bruise on her arm which disappeared after
five days but after confiding in her teachers about the incident
she made a formal complaint, the court official in the Spanish
city of Alicante told AFP.


His defence tried to argue that the father had a right to
administer punishment to his daughter but the judge ruled his
reaction had not been "proportionate, expedient, nor necessary".


The judge also imposed a restraining order on the father for 15
months. However, the man can appeal the sentence which could also
be changed into a non-custodial punishment.
