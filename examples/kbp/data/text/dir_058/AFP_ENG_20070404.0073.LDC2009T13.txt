Chinese share prices edged up marginally Wednesday to make it
another record finish as profit-taking took the market off early
highs, dealers said.


They said auto and machinery stocks attracted further support but
after the recent run of sustained gains, it was no surprise that
some investors wanted to take money off the table.


Volumes continued to pick up.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers both A- and
B-shares, closed up 0.24 points at 3,291.54, a new closing high,
on turnover of 113.26 billion yuan (14.61 billion dollars).


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 0.05 points at 3,459.51 on
turnover of 112.75 billion yuan and the Shenzhen A-share Index
was up 9.51 points or 1.06 percent at 903.08, also a record, on
turnover of 59.75 billion yuan.
