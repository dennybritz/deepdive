The Estonian parliament voted Wednesday for outgoing Prime
Minister Andrus Ansip to form the next government, following last
month's elections in the Baltic state, officials said.


Ansip received the backing of 62 members of parliament in the
101-member single- chamber legislature, according to the
parliament's press office.


None voted against and one abstained, while the remaining
lawmakers were either absent or did not take part.


Ansip, 50, is head of the right-of-centre, pro-business Reform
Party, which came top in the March 4 parliamentary elections.
