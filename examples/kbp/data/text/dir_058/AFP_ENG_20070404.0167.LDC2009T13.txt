A Briton and a Dutch national held hostage in volatile oil-rich
southern Nigeria have been released, the British High Commission
and an industry source said Wednesday.


"I can certainly say the Briton has been released," a spokesman
for the British High Commission told AFP.


Meanwhile, an industry source and a member of a militant group in
Port Harcourt, Nigeria's oil capital, both said a Dutch
expatriate worker had also been freed.


"We have confirmation of the release of the Dutch security
manager", the industry source said.


Armed men, whom security sources said were from a local
community, seized the Briton, identified as Gordon Gray from
Crieff in Perthshire, last Saturday, March 31, from an offshore
rig in the western Niger delta.


A Foreign Office spokeswoman said Gray "is in good health and has
been taken to the British deputy High Commission in Lagos".


Gray works as offshore installation manager with Aberdeen-based
Dolphin Drilling.


The Dutch man, who has not been identified, was kidnapped March
23 from Port Harcourt, where he is employed as security manager
for the Nigerian arm of German building company Bilfinger Berger.


The sources gave no details on the circumstances of the two men's
release and it is not clear if their kidnappers belong to the
same group.


Since the start of this year, more than 60 foreigners have been
kidnapped in southern Nigeria, at least as many as were abducted
during the whole of 2006.


The foreigners, most of whom have been released unharmed, were
seized by a mixture of criminal gangs out to make ransom money
and armed groups with a political agenda.
