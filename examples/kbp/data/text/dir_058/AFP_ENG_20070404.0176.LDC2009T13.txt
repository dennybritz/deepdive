The first joint university set up by South and North Korea will
open this year in Pyongyang against the backdrop of warming ties
between the two sides, the school authorities said here
Wednesday.


Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is set to open in
the capital of the communist country in September, with 150
graduate students enrolled on subjects including IT, food and
business.


"This is the first ever joint school set up by North and South
Korea," an official of the private Northeast Asia Foundation for
Education and Culture said.


All the courses will be given in English, he said.


The school's faculty will be composed of some 45 South Korean and
foreign professors and 10 general staff.


The foundation originally planned to open the school in April but
strained inter-Korean ties delayed the project.


Tensions eased after progress was made at six-party talks on
dismantling North Korea's nuclear programmes, enabling the
university to move forward, the official said.


Kim Jin-Kyong, dean of Yanbian Science and Technology College,
will be the first dean of the inter-Korean college, he said.


The project has cost the foundation some 17 million dollars since
2002, with North Korea providing construction workers and some
materials including sand and pebbles.


The college will consist of a five-storey building for lectures,
a four-storey building for a library, dining facilities and
research and five dormitory buildings.
