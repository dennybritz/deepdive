Israel on Wednesday arrested the head of a Palestinian militant
group tied to president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party in the West
Bank city of Jericho, Palestinian security sources said.


Israeli special forces nabbed Jihad Abu Haniya, 28, a leader of
the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, after raiding a house where he was
hiding, the sources said.


An Israeli army spokesman confirmed the arrest, saying: "A wanted
Fatah militant was arrested by a special police unit."


The Al-Aqsa Brigades includes dozens of disparate factions spread
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip and commanded by local
chiefs without central direction.
