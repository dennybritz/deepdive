Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday started a news
conference in which he was expected to address the row with
Britain over its arrested sailors and Iran's nuclear programme.


The conference, which was being shown live on Iranian television,
marks the start of the Iranian New Year on March 21 and is the
president's fifth such meeting with reporters since taking
office.


The event started with the reading of verses from the Koran on
Islamic unity as Ahmadinejad, dressed in a light suit, sat
solemnly behind a desk and a picture of a mosque.
