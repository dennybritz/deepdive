Gunmen wearing police uniforms kidnapped 22 shepherds and their
sheep in southern Iraq near the Shiite city of Karbala on
Wednesday, local police spokesman Rahman Mushawi said.


Travelling in three cars, the insurgents rounded up the
shepherds, confiscated their truck, herd and weapons and drove
them across the desert towards Fallujah in the neighbouring Sunni
province of Al-Anbar, he said.
