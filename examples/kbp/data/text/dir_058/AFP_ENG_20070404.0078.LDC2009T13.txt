A subsidiary of Italy's Eni energy giant won the latest auction
of assets of stricken oil company Yukos on Wednesday, paying 5.81
billion dollars for a package of assets.


"The package has been sold to Enineftegaz at a price of 151.53
billion rubles (5.81 billion dollars/4.36 billion euros)," a
spokesman for the state property fund said, referring to the Eni
subsidiary.


Enineftegaz was among three bidders for the package of assets.


Chief among these assets is a 20-percent stake in Gazprom Neft,
the oil- producing arm of the state-controlled gas giant Gazprom.


Also included are the Yukos subsidiaries Arktikgaz and Urengoil.


The other bidders at the auction at Yukos' headquarters were
Unitex, a subsidiary of Gazprom, and Nefttradegroup, a subsidiary
of state-controlled oil compay Rosneft.


Eni's win represents a symbolic breakthrough for the company
after months of negotiations with Russian authorities on
prospects for investing in upstream assets in the energy sector.


It comes after a subsidiary of Britain's BP lost to Rosneft last
week in another sale of Yukos assets.


The Kremlin has been anxious to ensure the participation of
Western majors in order to lend credibility to Yukos'
controversial break-up.


The dismemberment of Russia's former number one oil producer and
the jailing of its head, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, cast a cloud of
President Vladimir Putin's rule as critics in Russia and the West
described it as a selective and politically motivated assault.
