A court sentenced Sri Lanka's former cricket chief Thilanga
Sumathipala to two years in jail Wednesday for breaking the
island's immigration laws, officials said.


Sumathipala was charged with taking an alleged underworld leader
named Dhammika Amarasinghe to England on forged travel documents
to watch the 1999 cricket world cup.


The 42-year-old businessman was also fined 50,000 rupees (450 US)
by Colombo additional Magistrate Ajith Anavaratne who read out
the sentence in the case which began in 2003.


Lawyers for Sumathipala, the former chairman of Sri Lanka's board
of control for cricket, said he would appeal the sentence.
