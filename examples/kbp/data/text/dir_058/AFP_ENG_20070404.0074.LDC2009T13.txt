General Motors unit GM Daewoo Auto Technology said Wednesday it
was well in the black for 2006 and posted its first operating
profit since its creation four years earlier.


The carmaker said its 2006 operating profit -- a broad measure of
earnings before tax and other charges -- was 335.6 billion won
(358 million dollars), more than reversing the previous year's
loss of 28.8 billion won.


"It marked the first time that the company has posted an
operating profit since its creation in 2002," a company spokesman
said.


Net profit was 592.8 billion won in 2006, up sharply from 65.5
billion won, while sales rose 27.5 percent to 9.6 trillion won
(10.3 billion dollars).


Domestic sales were up 19.2 percent to 128,332 vehicles,
supported by new passenger and sport utility models and
aggressive marketing, while exports rose 33.1 percent to 1.40
million units.


GM Daewoo set a sales target of 1.8 million units this year, up
from last year's 1.526 million units.


GM Daewoo Auto Technology came into being when General Motors
bought Daewoo Motor in 2002 as the firm was reeling under heavy
debts in the aftermath of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis.
