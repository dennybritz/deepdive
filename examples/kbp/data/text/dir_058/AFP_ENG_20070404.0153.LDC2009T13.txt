Dozens of Taliban militants have been killed and captured in more
than 200 engagements with NATO-led and Afghan security forces
during a major operation launched a month ago, the alliance said
Wednesday.


Those captured or killed during the NATO-led Operation Achilles
launched in the southern province of Helmand on March 6 included
some "big extremist leaders," spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel
Maria Carl told reporters.


"We have had over 200 engagements, tactical engagements in
Operation Achilles," she said, adding: "We're finding that the
enemy is not engaging us as much as they were before."


Carl could not give a precise figure for those captured or
killed.


Three international soldiers -- two British and one US national
-- have also been killed, a military official has said
previously.


Carl said Taliban communication and command structures had been
disrupted during the operation involving about 4,500 troops from
NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and about
1,000 from the Afghan army.


Achilles is primarily aimed at providing security to allow for
reconstruction work in the province.


Among the key projects is a hydropower dam, which will provide
electricity for some 1.7 million Afghans in Helmand and the
neighbouring province of Kandahar.


The Taliban movement was overthrown from government in a US-led
invasion in late 2001 and is now waging an insurgency that is
particularly active in the south and southeast of the country.
