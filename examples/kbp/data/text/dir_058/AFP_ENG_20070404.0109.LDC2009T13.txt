Japanese retail giant Aeon Co. said Wednesday its annual net
earnings almost doubled while operating profit hit another record
high, driven by brisk sales at its mainstay supermarkets.


Aeon, which has just teamed up with ailing rival Daiei to create
Japan's largest retail group, said net profit rose to 57.66
billion yen (485.4 million dollars) in the year to February from
28.93 billion yen the previous year.


Operating profit gained to 189.73 billion yen from 166.10 billion
yen.


"We achieved record profits in operating and current earnings for
the seventh straight year, which we believe resulted from our
efforts to strengthen store infrastructure and product
portfolios," Aeon senior managing director Masaaki Toyoshima told
a news conference.


Group sales expanded 8.9 percent to a record 4.82 trillion yen,
Aeon said.


The growth in net profit was more pronounced than in revenue
because of a decline in balance sheet restructuring costs, the
company said.


For the fiscal year ending next February, Aeon forecasts
operating profit of 200-210 billion yen and net profit of 70-76
billion yen on revenue of over 5.25 trillion yen.


These projections do not include possible earnings from Aeon's
newly acquired equity stakes in Daiei Inc. and affiliate Maruetsu
Inc. because these companies have yet to give Aeon their outlooks
for this fiscal year, Aeon said.


Aeon purchased 15 percent of Daiei and 20 percent of Maruetsu
last month.
