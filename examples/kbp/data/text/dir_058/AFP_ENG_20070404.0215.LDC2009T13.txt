France got a rare glimpse of their president's only grandchild
Wednesday, after 11-year-old Martin Rey-Chirac was photographed
next to his grandfather watching military exercises in the
southwestern town of Bayonne.


The son of Jacques Chirac's daughter Claude and Olympic judo
champion Thierry Rey, Martin was shown in leather jacket and
sweatshirt on the front page of the popular daily Aujourd'hui -
Le Parisien.


French journalists traditionally keep a respectful distance from
the private lives of politicians, and Martin's face is virtually
unknown to the public.


The photograph was published just a few weeks before Chirac steps
down after 12 years as president.


Chirac has two daughters: Claude, 44, who acts as his media
advisor, and Laurence, 49, who suffers from a mental disorder and
lives in an institution.
