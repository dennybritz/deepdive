At least 20 percent of reservists in Israel's ground forces are
incapable of handling their weapons, the Yediot Aharonot
newspaper said Wednesday, citing army sources.


The paper said the figures were gathered during reservist
training since November, with tank, artillery and engineering
units showing the worst performances.


Israel's new army chief of staff, Gabi Ashkenazi, has said the
training of reservists would be one of his top priorities
following last year's inconclusive war against the Hezbollah
militia in Lebanon.
