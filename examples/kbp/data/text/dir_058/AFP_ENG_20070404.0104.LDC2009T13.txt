Britain's Office of Fair Trading on Wednesday announced a probe
into the distribution of medicines across the country after US
drug maker Pfizer awarded an exclusive license to Alliance Boots.


Pfizer's recent appointment of Unichem, the drug wholesaling arm
of European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, caused an outcry from
rival distributors and some chemists who claimed the deal would
hamper competition.


Previously, drug makers used a number of competing wholesalers to
distribute their drugs to hospitals, pharmacies and dispensing
doctors.


"Until recently all medicines were distributed through a number
of competing wholesalers but in March 2007 Pfizer Limited began
selling prescription drugs solely through one wholesaler,
Unichem," the OFT said on Wednesday.


"Other suppliers are also considering introducing significant
changes to their own distribution arrangements.


"The study will consider the likely impact of such changes on
competition, the NHS (National Health Service) and patients and
will report back by the end of the year."


The OFT added that Britain's state-run National Health Service
spends more than 10.0 billion pounds (14.8 billion euros, 19.8
billion dollars) on prescription drugs per year.


In response to the investigation, Alliance Unichem said in a
short statement that it would not affect the operation of its
distribution arrangements with Pfizer.
