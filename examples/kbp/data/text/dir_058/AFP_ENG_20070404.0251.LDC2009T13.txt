Indian share prices closed 1.28 percent higher Wednesday as Asian
markets recovered on lower oil prices and a rally on Wall Street,
dealers said.


They said local funds bought into mid and small-cap stocks on
bargain hunting after the markets posted the sharpest fall in
nearly a year on Monday as inflation concerns eased.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex closed up
162.19 points at 12,786.77.


On Monday, the Sensex endured its biggest one-day drop since May
18, 2006 after the central bank hiked a key short-term lending
rate by a quarter point to 7.75 percent late last week.


"The recovery in global markets boosted sentiment here. Investors
will watch inflation data and full-year corporate earnings to
determine future buying activity," said Hiten Mehta, a fund
manager with Fortune Financial Services.


The rupee rose to an eight-year high against the dollar of 42.9
from 43.1 as banks sold dollars to raise funds in rupees to meet
India's central bank requirements for higher cash reserves.


The rupee gained against the euro to 57.2 from 57.6.


Gainers led losers 1,581 to 899 on volume of 32.18 billion rupees
(750 million dollars).


Housing finance company HDFC rose 73.3 rupees or 5.15 percent to
1,497.2 while private sector ICICI Bank rose 16.6 rupees or two
percent to 820.5 on fresh buying after a recent sell-off triggred
by the interest rate hike.
