Ukrainian Constitutional Court judges refused to accept the
resignation of their top judge Wednesday, dragging the court
deeper into the country's raging political turmoil.


"The Constitutional Court refused the resignation" of its
president, Ivan Dombrovsky, court spokesman Ivan Avramov told
AFP.


Dombrovsky had tendered his resignation earlier Wednesday, a day
after a group of parliamentary deputies asked the court to rule
against President Viktor Yushchenko's order to dissolve
parliament.


The order by the pro-Western president sparked a political crisis
when it was rejected by the pro-Russian parliamentary majority,
which has battled the president since taking power in March 2006.
