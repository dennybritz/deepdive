Gunmen ambushed and killed five Iraqi workers from a power plant
as they came off night shift and were travelling home south of
the oil city of Kirkuk on Wednesday, their boss said.


The five -- all Sunni Arab men -- were gunned down as their bus
headed to the town of Hawija, said Jameel Abdallah, the power
plant's director.


Six months ago, the director's predecessor Abdallah Hamza Bayati
was killed in a similar insurgent attack, Abdallah said.


Insurgent attacks have been on the increase in Kirkuk, which sits
on a third of Iraq's oil resources and is home to a fractious
ethnic and sectarian mix.


Longstanding Kurdish demands for the city to be incorporated into
their autonomous region in northern Iraq -- and strongly resisted
by Arabs -- are due to be put to a referendum before the end of
the year.
