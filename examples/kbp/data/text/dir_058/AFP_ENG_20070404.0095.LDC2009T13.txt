Hong Kong tycoon Nina Wang, believed to be the richest woman in
Asia, has died, her secretary said Wednesday.


"Mrs Wang passed away (Tuesday) night," secretary Ringo Wong told
AFP.


Wang, who emerged victorious from a long and bruising court
battle over her late husband's estate, died at an undisclosed
Hong Kong hospital, Wong said without indicating the cause of
death.


Despite a fortune estimated at more than four billion US dollars,
her frugality was widely documented by Hong Kong media, who
nicknamed her "Little Sweetie" because her trademark pigtails
resembled a Japanese comic character.


She once admitted that her favourite meal was American fast food
and was reputed to have kept her monthly expenditure below 3,000
Hong Kong dollars (385 US).


Wang and husband Teddy -- who was declared legally dead in 1999,
nine years after he was kidnapped and never heard from again --
were together so thrifty they were known to buy cut-price tickets
to shows.


Teddy built up Chinachem, mostly on real estate deals, and she
helped transform it after his disappearance into a 3.5 billion US
dollar empire that owns more than 200 office towers and 400
companies around the world.


Forbes magazine last year estimated her personal fortune at 4.2
billion US dollars, 154th in their ranking of the world's richest
people.
