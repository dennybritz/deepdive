Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was holding a news
conference in which he was expected to address the row with
Britain over its detained sailors and Iran's nuclear programme.


The conference, which was being shown live on Iranian television,
is the president's fifth such meeting with reporters since taking
office.


The event started with the reading of verses from the Koran on
Islamic unity as Ahmadinejad, dressed in a light suit, sat
solemnly behind a desk and a picture of the prophet Mohammed's
mosque in the holy Saudi city of Medina.


The president then started the news conference by reading a
lengthy sermon relating how the prophets were sent to earth by
God to lead people towards salvation.


"Cling firmly together by means of God's rope and do not
separate," read a text printed in a blue background behind the
president.
