French insurance giant AXA plans to axe around 1,200 jobs in
Germany by 2010 following its recent takeover of Swiss rival
Winterthur, a company spokesman said Wednesday.


The number represents around 10 percent of the combined workforce
of both companies in Germany.


The job cuts would be implemented without any compulsory
redundancies, AXA said.


The aim was to cut costs by around 120 million euros (160 million
dollars) over the next three years.


Negotiations with employee representatives were expected to reach
a final agreement at the end of the third quarter.


AXA currently employs a workforce of 8,200 in Germany and DBV-
Winterthur employs a further 4,100.
