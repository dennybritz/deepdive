Five Christians went on trial in Indonesia on Wednesday for
brutally murdering two Muslims, a charge carrying the death
penalty.


They are accused of slitting one victim's throat and beating the
other to death in Indonesia's religiously divided district of
Poso, where Muslims and Christians live in roughly equal numbers.


Prosecutor Totok Bambang told the court in the capital, Jakarta,
that the five men "carried out acts of terror ... causing the
deaths of two persons."


A dozen other Christians are accused of the same crime but are
being tried separately. Both cases fall under Indonesia's anti-
terror laws.


Prosecutors have said that the Christians dragged the two Muslim
fish traders from a truck on Sulawesi island before murdering
them.


The gang of men had allegedly set up roadblocks in Poso in
September last year, hours after three Christian militants had
been executed for killing Muslims during earlier bloody unrest in
the district.


The fish traders were buried on a nearby mountain and their truck
pushed into a ravine, but their bodies were discovered two days
later.


Poso became internationally notorious in 2005 when Islamic
militants beheaded three teenage Christian schoolgirls, a crime
that drew wide condemnation.


Unrest in the district flared during 2000 and 2001, leading to
about 1,000 deaths.


The court was adjourned until April 12, when testimony from
witnesses will be heard.
