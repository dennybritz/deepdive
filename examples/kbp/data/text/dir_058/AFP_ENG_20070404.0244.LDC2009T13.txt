A former vice president of Sicily was placed under house arrest
on Wednesday and five other people arrested over alleged Mafia
involvement in public tenders, Italian police said.


Bartolo Pellegrino, 73, is suspected of corruption and supporting
a Mafia association for his alleged role in the distribution of
public tenders, a police spokesman said.


Formerly also an official responsible for budget and environment
matters between 2001 and 2006 in the regional centre-right
government, he is accused of regular contacts with Mafia bosses
in western Sicily and supporting their interests, the arrest
warrant issued by the Palermo prosecutor was quoted as saying by
the ANSA news agency.


Property and shares valued at 10 million euros have also been
seized, ANSA said.


The arrest and questioning of local political officials over
suspected ties with the Mafia is a frequent occurrence in Sicily,
where the president of the region Salvatore Cuffaro is currently
being tried for his alleged support of the Cosa Nostra.
