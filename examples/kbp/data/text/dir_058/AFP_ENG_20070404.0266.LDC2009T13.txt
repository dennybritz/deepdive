A strong blast shook an ethnic Albanian populated town in
Serbia's tense south overnight, causing no injuries but material
damage, Beta news agency reported Wednesday.


"It was certainly an explosive device planted in the yard of the
municipality building" of Presevo, a town some 350 kilometres
(210 miles) south of the capital Belgrade, mayor Ragmi Mustafa
told the agency.


The explosion, which occurred at 11:30 pm (2130 GMT), shattered
windows of the building and roused inhabitants of the small town.


Serbia's Presevo Valley region was the scene of an ethnic
Albanian rebellion in 2000-2001 that ended with a Western-
brokered peace accord granting more rights to the minority.


At the time, extremist ethnic Albanian forces in Presevo Valley
had been calling for separation of the region and for its
integration with neighbouring Kosovo.
