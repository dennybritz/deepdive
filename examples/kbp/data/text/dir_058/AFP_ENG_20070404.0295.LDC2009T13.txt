Under-fire Greg Chappell has resigned as India's cricket coach
following the team's first round exit from the World Cup, sources
told AFP on Wednesday.


Chappell, 58, sent an e-mail to Indian cricket board president
Sharad Pawar, saying he did not wish to renew his contract as
coach for "family and personal reasons," the sources said.


The former Australian captain has served as coach since June 2005
and his two- year contract was due to end on May 31.


His resignation comes two days before the Board of Control for
Cricket in India (BCCI) meets in Mumbai on Friday and Saturday to
take stock of the World Cup debacle.


Chappell will, however, attend the meeting to present his report
on the team's dismal performance, the sources added.


India were upset by Bangladesh and also lost to Sri Lanka to be
knocked out in the preliminary stage of the ongoing World Cup in
the Caribbean.
