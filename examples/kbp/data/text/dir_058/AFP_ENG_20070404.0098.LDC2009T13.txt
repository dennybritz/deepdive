Five Iranian officials arrested by US forces in Iraq in January
are to meet an Iranian diplomat for the first time since their
capture, the official IRNA news agency reported on Wednesday.


The United States accuses the men, who were arrested during a US
raid on an Iranian office in the northern Iraqi city of Arbil of
being members of the elite Al-Quds brigade of Iran's
Revolutionary Guards.


Iran insists they are diplomats working for a "consulate".


"Thanks to the efforts of Iran's diplomats in Baghad, the
cooperation of Iraqi officials and the UN representative, it is
expected that a representative of the embassy will meet the
(detained) diplomats," an Iranian source, which was not
identified, told IRNA in Baghdad.


The United States has rejected any suggestion that the 15 British
naval personnel detained by Iran for the past two weeks could be
swapped for the five Iranian officials.


US officials have said computers and other equipment seized
during the raid provided information linking the Iranians to
networks that supplied technology and material to Iraqi
insurgents to help them carry out attacks on US forces.


An International Committee of the Red Cross representative in
March met the five Iranian officials and they were said to be in
good health.
