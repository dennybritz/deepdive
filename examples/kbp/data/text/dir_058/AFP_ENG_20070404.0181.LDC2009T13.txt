The mooted creation of a "gas OPEC" would not push prices up in
the short-term, Russian Economic Development Minister German Gref
said Wednesday in an interview with the Spanish daily Cinco Dias.


"I don't think that in the short-term, quickly, there will be
changes which would imply a change in price" if an organisation
of gas-producing countries is formed, said Gref.


On April 9, gas-producing states are to meet in Doha, where the
creation of such a cartel, based on the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), might be discussed.


The idea of such an organisation "was launched openly, but no
firm plans have been made either way (...) The shape this idea
will take has not yet been decided, and our entry into this type
of cartel will have to be discussed," added Gref.


The creation of a gas cartel has raised concern among consumer
countries, especially European nations which are heavily
dependent on gas from Russia and Algeria, two potential cartel
members.


The Russian daily Kommersant reported in mid-March that five of
the main producers, Algeria, Qatar, Iran, Russia and Venezuela,
would launch a "gas OPEC" during the OPEF (Forum of gas-exporting
countries) in Doha.


On Monday however, the Spanish daily El Pais quoted Kazakhstan
President Nursultan Nazarbayev as saying the creation of such a
cartel was not imminent.


"We talk about this, and amongst gas producing countries the
desire exists for it but I believe we will not arrive at the
creation of a gas OPEC for the moment," Nazarbayev said.
