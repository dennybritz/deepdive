Sri Lankan warplanes bombed a key Tamil Tiger naval base in the
island's northeast Wednesday, the defence ministry said.


Israeli-built Kfir jets pounded the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam base at Puthukudirrippu, a ministry spokesman said.


There was no immediate reaction from the Tigers. Sri Lankan
warplanes have been routinely bombing suspected rebel positions
in the island's northeast since April last year as part of a new
wave of violence.
