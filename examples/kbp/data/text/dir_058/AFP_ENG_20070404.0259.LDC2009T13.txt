Rightwing presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday
that if elected he would promote the building of new mosques and
take steps to cut the dependence of French Islamic bodies on
foreign support.


"What good is it to tell our Muslim compatriots that they have
the same rights as everyone else, if they're forced to pray in
cellars and garages," he said in an interview with La Croix
newspaper.


"The problems of terrorism occur in the cellars and garages --
not in the Grand Mosque of Paris or Lyon. And I also want to cut
the Islam of France from foreign influences, whether it's for the
funding of places of worship or the training of imams," he said.


As interior minister for four of the last five years, Sarkozy set
up the French Council for the Muslim Religion (CFCM) -- the first
officially recognised Islamic body in French history.


He also supported changes to France's 1905 law separating church
and state in order allow local authorities to build Muslim places
of worship. However his proposal triggered bitter opposition from
secularists and he told La Croix he would only proceed on the
basis of consensus.


France's main Islamic groups are dependent on support from
countries including Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia because
they lack the means to provide their own mosques or training-
colleges.
