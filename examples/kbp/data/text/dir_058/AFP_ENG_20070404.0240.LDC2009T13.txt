The rightwing opposition led by former Italian premier Silvio
Berlusconi is riding high in the polls, leading the government
coalition by 12 points, according to a poll published on
Wednesday.


Berlusconi's opposition grouping would win 48 percent of the vote
were an election to be held now, against 43 percent for the
governing coalition of Romano Prodi, according to the poll
published in the La Repubblica daily.


However, taken together with the centrist Christian Democrats,
who occasionally vote with Prodi's centre left government yet
declare themselves in the opposition, the group would win 55
percent of the vote in an election.


The poll appears to confirm how far Prodi's government has fallen
out of favour with the electorate following a series of political
crises that last month saw the prime minister tender his
resignation after losing a key vote in the Senate.


In last year's election, Prodi's group of centre-left parties won
49.8 percent of the vote against Berlusconi's governing centre-
right coalition which garnered a fraction less, 49.7 percent.
