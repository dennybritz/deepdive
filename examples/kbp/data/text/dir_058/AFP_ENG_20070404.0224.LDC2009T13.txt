Villarreal's Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan has turned down a
chance to return to the English Premiership, the player confirmed
here on Wednesday.


Forlan was the Spanish first division's top scorer two seasons
ago and the joint winner of the European Golden Boot award in
2005 but is chiefly known in England for his difficult two
seasons at Manchester United between 2002-04.


English second tier side Sunderland, coached by Forlan's former
United teammate Roy Keane, look on course for promotion to the
Premiership and he wanted Forlan to bolster their attack next
season.


But the former Republic of Ireland international failed to
convince Forlan to swap life by the Mediterranean for Tyneside.


"Roy called me to explain his project at Sunderland and offer me
the possibility of playing there as one of the main new signings
for next season. I'm very honoured (he called) but I'm happy
here," Forlan told local reporters.


Nevertheless, despite turning down Sunderland and the fact that
Forlan's stint in the top flight of English football isn't
remembered too fondly - he was cruelly nicknamed Diego Forlorn by
United supporters for his failure to find the net - Forlan didn't
discount playing in the Premiership again.


"Nothing is impossible in football. I could return there one
day," he added.
