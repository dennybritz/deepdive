Dozens of South Korean lawmakers sent a letter to Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday urging him to apologise for
denying that Tokyo coerced women to sexually serve its troops in
World War II.


"Japan must apologise to the victims of sex slavery and pay
compensations to them," the letter said, according to Chae Su-
Chan, who led the group of 47 lawmakers that signed the letter.


Historians say more than 200,000 women, mostly from Korea and
China, were forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese troops.


The lawmakers said South Korea and other countries would work to
shed more light on wartime sex slavery unless Abe and his
government admits that the Japanese army forced Asian women to
serve them sexually in military brothels.


Abe sparked anger in the region when he said last month that
there was no evidence Tokyo coerced Asian women to serve in
brothels for its troops in World War II.


Seoul has expressed "deep regrets" over Abe's comments, which
ignited a furore in Asian nations that were invaded by Japan.


Abe has since tried to cool the row, saying he "sincerely" stood
by the previous Tokyo government's 1993 apology for wartime sex
slavery.


During talks with his South Korean counterpart Song Min-Soon,
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso reiterated that Abe stood by
the 1993 apology to so-called comfort women, and the statement
that the imperial army was involved "directly or indirectly" in
their recruitment.
