Filmmaker Sydney Pollack will direct a telefilm on the bitter
Florida recount that decided the nail-biting 2000 US presidential
election, the entertainment daily Variety reported Monday.


The Oscar-winning Pollack has been hired by the cable chain HBO
to depict the harrowing weeks after the November election that
sealed George W. Bush's victory over Al Gore by a mere 537 votes
in Florida.


The recount in the southeastern state went through a series of
twists, turns and court rulings before it was finally decided in
Bush's favor by a 5-4 decision of the US Supreme Court.


Pollack's telefilm "Recount," is scheduled to be aired in the
spring of 2008, when the wide-open campaign to succeed Bush in
the White House will be in full throttle.


The telefilm is also expected to be available on the Internet,
according to Variety, the show-business bible.


Pollack, 72, has a best-director Academy Award to his credit for
the 1986 film "Out of Africa" with Meryl Streep and Robert
Redford.


He has also directed such classics as "Three Days of the Condor"
and "Tootsie" and most recently filmed "The Intepreter" with
Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn.


There was no immediate word whom he was lining up to play Bush
and Gore in the real-life political drama that kept the world on
edge for months in 2000.
