The United States was aiming to seize two top Iranian security
officials in a January raid in Arbil, the capital of the northern
Iraqi Kurdistan region, when it came away with six Iranian
employees, The Independent reported on Tuesday.


In the early hours of January 11, US troops dropped from
helicopters stormed an Iranian liaison office in Arbil and
detained the six, one of whom was later released.


According to The Independent, the real targets of that raid were
Mohammed Jafari, the deputy head of the Iranian National Security
Council, and General Minojahar Frouzanda, the Revolutionary
Guard's chief of intelligence.


"They were after Jafari," said Fuad Hussein, the chief of staff
of Massoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan Regional
Government.


"The Americans thought he (Jafari) was there."


Sadi Ahmed Pire, currently head of Iraqi President Jalal
Talabani's office in Baghdad, also told the daily that Jafari --
in Kurdistan on an official visit -- was accompanied by
Frouzanda.


"His name was General Minojahar Frouzanda, the head of
intelligence of the Pasdaran (the Iranian Revolutionary Guard),"
said Pire, who previously lived in Arbil when he headed
Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party.
