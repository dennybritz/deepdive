Conglomerate Wesfarmers said Tuesday it had led a share raid on
Australian retail giant Coles which netted it an 11.3 percent
stake in the company which is being put up for sale.


"Wesfarmers is at this time pursuing discussions with Coles," it
said, announcing the acquisition of the shares.


Shares in Coles and Westfarmers were both suspended on the
announcement.


Reports said Wesfarmers is part of a consortium with investment
bank Macquarie Bank, local private outfit Pacific Equity Partners
and Europe's Permira to launch a bid worth more than 2.0 billion
dollars (1.6 billion US) to snare the country's second largest
retailer.


Wesfarmers launched their raid late Monday, paying 16.47 dollars
per share, reports said.


The move comes as rival private-equity consortium, led by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, considers making another offer for the
group. The consortium's offer of 15.25 dollars per share was last
year rejected by Coles as significantly below its true value.


Coles has been seeking a competitive auction of its interests --
which include supermarkets, liquor stores, an office supply
chain, and budget retail outlets Target and Kmart -- since
February when it announced it would not achieve its profit target
for 2008.


Coles closed down 0.14 dollars at 16.11 dollars on Monday, giving
the group a market capitalization of 19.25 billion dollars.
