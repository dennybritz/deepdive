A 74-year-old Indonesian with 107 wives has reportedly been
jailed for beating one of them in front of three others --
because he suspected she had been unfaithful.


The victim recounted the crime to police on Muslim-majority
Indonesia's main island of Java, the Koran Tempo newspaper said.


A local police chief was quoted as saying that the husband,
Abdurahman, was guilty of torturing Tariah, his second wife.


Islam permits up to four wives and polygamy is thought to be
widespread in Indonesia. Only four of Abdurahman's wives were
still living with him.


He said he had 41 children and "countless grandchildren,"
according to the newspaper.
