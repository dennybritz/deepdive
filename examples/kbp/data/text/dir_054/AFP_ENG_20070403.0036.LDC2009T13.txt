Indian share prices were up by nearly half a percent in early
trade Tuesday on bargain-hunting after posting the sharpest fall
in nearly a year, a day earlier, dealers said.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex was up 49.81
points or 0.40 percent at 12,505.18 points at 0510 GMT.


On Monday, the Sensex slid 4.72 percent to 12,455.37, its biggest
one-day drop since May 18, 2006, after the central bank hiked a
key short-term lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to
7.75 percent.


Dealers said there was some bargain hunting but concern that the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may take more steps to cool inflation
had capped gains.


Inflation is riding at 6.46 percent, nearly a percentage point
above the bank's tolerance range of 5.50 to 5.50 percent.


"Investors remain cautious, fearing a further hike by the RBI.
The market will remain rangebound until the end of April," said
Vijay Tilakraj, chief dealer at Prabhudas Lillabher.


The market is now looking ahead to the central bank's quarterly
review of the economy on April 24 to determine if further rate
hikes are likely, with some hopeful that a tightening cycle that
began in 2004 will come to an end,.
