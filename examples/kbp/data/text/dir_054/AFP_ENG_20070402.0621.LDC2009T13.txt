US funding has tightened security at Russian nuclear sites, but
whether the stricter controls can be sustained remains to be
seen, a US official report said Monday.


Since 1993, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy have helped
to provide security upgrades and other assistance for sites in
Russia and other countries where weapons-usuable nuclear material
and warheads are stored.


The program cost some 2.2 billion dollars in 2006 alone, the
report from the US Government Accountability Office said.


The US Department of Energy reported that some 175 buildings had
already been secured and there were plans to secure a further 35
buildings by the end of 2008.


Security has been bolstered at some 62 Russian warhead sites,
with another 35 such sites to be brought into line by the end of
next year.


But the report said the abilities of the two departments "to
ensure the sustainability of US-funded security upgrades may be
hampered by access difficulties, funding concerns and other
issues."
