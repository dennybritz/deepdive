A small group of Thai activists on Tuesday rallied outside the
Japanese embassy in Bangkok to protest against a free-trade deal,
which leaders of the two countries are set to sign in Tokyo.


The 30 demonstrators burned a mock Japan-Thailand free trade
agreement document in front of the embassy and held a Thai-
language banner that said "Free Trade Agreement with Japan is
horrible. It only benefits Japan."


The peaceful protest came just hours before Thailand's army-
installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont and his Japanese
counterpart Shinzo Abe are to sign the pact later in the day in
Tokyo.


The agreement was negotiated by Thailand's twice-elected prime
minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire-turned-politician, who
was ousted by the military in a September coup.


Despite mounting protests at home, Surayud's government approved
the trade deal last week, hoping that it would ease business
worries in Japan, Thailand's largest investor, about
protectionist policies since the military takeover.


But Japan has historic political and economic ties with Thailand,
with many Japanese firms, such as auto giants Toyota, Nissan and
Honda, using Bangkok as a regional production hub.


Under the agreement, Japan and Thailand will lift tariffs on more
than 90 percent of trade in 10 years and Bangkok has vowed to
step up transparency and legal protections to help Japanese
investors.


But Thai activists have lashed out against the deal, saying it
will turn Thailand into a dumping ground for Japan's toxic waste.
