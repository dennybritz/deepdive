UN chief Ban Ki-moon said Monday he was concerned about the
effects of a tsunami which hit the Solomon Islands, adding a UN
team was ready to travel to the stricken South Pacific state.


"The secretary-general is deeply concerned by the potential
consequences of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Solomon
Islands and Papua New Guinea," spokeswoman Michele Montas said.


"The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs has a team ready to deploy to the Solomon Islands and has
offered assistance to the government."


A powerful undersea earthquake unleashed a tsunami that pounded
the Solomon Islands on Monday, destroying entire villages and
killing at least 15 people, with the toll expected to rise,
officials in Honiara said.


The wall of water triggered by the 8.0-magnitude quake -- which
witnesses said was up to five meters (16.5 feet) high -- swamped
towns, flattened homes, and sparked panic among residents of the
impoverished country.


The Solomon Islands, 2,575 kilometres (1,600 miles) east of
Australia, has a little over half a million people living on
dozens of islands, although hundreds more are uninhabited.


An earthquake off Indonesia's island of Sumatra in December 2004
spawned a tsunami that spread across the Indian Ocean, killing
220,000 people. The United Nations launched an emergency appeal
at the time for some 1.6 billion dollars.
