Thousands of people in the western Solomon Islands slept on
hilltops overnight fearing another deadly quake as aftershocks
rocked the region, local officials said Tuesday.


The government information service Tuesday quoted a former
Solomon Islands governor-general, Sir Moses Pitakaka, saying from
the Western Province town of Gizo that thousands were homeless
there after Monday's quake-spawned tsunami.


Pitakaka said thousands more were likely to have lost their homes
in other affected areas in the west of the impoverished South
Pacific country.


The Solomon Islands Red Cross estimated approximately 2,000
people, or 10 percent of Gizo's population, were now homeless.
Some 500 houses may have been damaged or destroyed.


Preliminary reports from other islands suggest similar or worse
levels of damage, the government said in a statement.


Gizo, a popular diving centre, lies just 45 kilometres (28 miles)
from the epicentre of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake Monday which
triggered the tsunami. Areas in Western Province and neighbouring
Choiseul province bore the brunt of the damage.


Deputy police commissioner Peter Marshall said there were 20
confirmed dead so far and he feared the toll would rise.


Police spokesman Mick Spinks said reports had come in of 13
villages being destroyed by the tsunami.
