Royal Air Force pilots were asked by a senior RAF official to
consider flying so-called "kamikaze" flights as part of the war
on terror, the British defence ministry confirmed on Tuesday.


Air Vice-Marshal David Walker did not, however, say he would
order his crews on suicide missions, a spokesman for the ministry
stressed, saying that Walker was instead simply posing a scenario
for pilots to think about.


According to The Sun tabloid, Walker told air crews at a
conference on Monday: "Would you think it unreasonable if I
ordered you to fly your aircraft into the ground in order to
destroy a vehicle carrying a Taliban or Al-Qaeda commander?"


The defence ministry spokesman, however, insisted that Walker did
not say he would order his crews to conduct "kamikaze" missions,
named after suicide attacks by Japanese pilots during World War
II.


"As part of a training exercise, he wanted them to think about
how they, and their commanders, would react, faced with a life
and death decision of the most extreme sort -- for example
terrorists trying to fly an aircraft into a British city being
followed by an RAF fighter which suffers weapons failure," the
spokesman said.


"These are decisions which, however unlikely and dreadful,
service people may have to make and it is one of many reasons why
the British people hold them in such high esteem."
