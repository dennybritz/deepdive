The Japanese president of a controversial company controlled by
Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church was kidnapped in Paraguay
along with his secretary, police said Monday.


Kidnappers demanded 250,000 dollars to release Hirokazu Ota, 62,
the president of Victoria S.A., and his secretary, also a
Japanese national, police said.


They also seized a policeman and his girlfriend who by chance
witnessed the kidnapping in Caaguazu, about 200 kilometers (120
miles) east of the capital.


The secretary was identified as Sawako Takayama, but reports in
Japan gave her family name as Yamaguchi.


The two were travelling from Ciudad del Este on the Brazil border
to Asuncion when they were seized.


Victoria manages land assets in Paraguay owned by the South
Korea-based Unification Church, and has sparked controversy for
several years for buying up thousands of hectares in the Chaco
region in the country's center.


Deputy police commander Pedro Mendez said they suspect that the
kidnappers could be part of a gang which nabbed several people in
the Ciudad del Este region in March.


"They have all been identified," he said.


Japan's Kyodo news agency reported that the Paraguay police have
arrested several people in connection with the case, but said it
is not known whether the abductees are safe.


In Tokyo the a Japanese foreign ministry official declined to
comment on the case "due to its sensitive nature."


Ota has been engaged in activities of the Unification Church for
about 10 years both in Japan and Paraguay, Jiji Press said.
