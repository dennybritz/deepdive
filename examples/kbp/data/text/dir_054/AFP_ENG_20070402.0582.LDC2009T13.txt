Ottawa announced Monday it would spend 900 million Canadian
dollars (780 million US) over the next five years to boost its
aerospace industry.


The funds would be used by local companies for "research and
development," Industry Minister Maxime Bernier said in a
statement.


Most Canadian aerospace companies are based in Quebec province,
including aircraft manufacturer Bombardier, engine builder Pratt
and Whitney Canada, components maker Heroux-Devtek, and CAE, a
leading flight-simulator firm.


The Canadian aerospace sector had sales of 21.8 billion dollars
(18.9 billion US), exports of 18.5 billion dollars (16 billion
US), and employed 75,000 Canadians in 2005.
