Algeria unveiled on Monday a 550-million-euro (740-million-
dollar) programme to wipe out illiteracy by 2016.


"The programme ... will pay particular attention to categories
the worst hit by illiteracy: women, rural populations, the
disabled and nomads," Education Minister Boubekeur Benbouzid
said.


Around 6.4 million people in Algeria are estimated to be
illiterate out of a population of around 33 million.
