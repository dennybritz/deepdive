A powerful quake hit northeastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, sending
people running out of their homes in the capital Kabul and
rocking neighbouring Pakistan.


The 6.2-magnitude quake struck in the Hindu Kush region and was
nearly 200 kilometres (125 miles) underground, the US Geological
Survey said.


There was no immediate word on damage or casualties from the
quake, which hit near Feyzabad shortly after 8:00 am (0300 GMT).


In Kabul some 260 kilometres away, hundreds of people ran from
their homes. "Everyone in my neighbourhood rushed out," a
resident said.


It was also felt in the eastern city of Jalalabad, an AFP
reporter in the city said. People fled their homes but there was
no word on damage.


In Pakistan, officials estimated its magnitude at 6.0 on the
Richter scale. There were no immediate reports of losses.


Afghanistan is often hit by earthquakes, especially around the
Hindu Kush mountain range that is near the collision of the
Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, where seismic activity is
high.


The country has been battered by days of heavy spring rains and
avalanches, with some reports saying 80 people were killed over
the past weeks.


Up to 25,000 people have been affected and hundreds airlifted to
safety, according to the United Nations.
