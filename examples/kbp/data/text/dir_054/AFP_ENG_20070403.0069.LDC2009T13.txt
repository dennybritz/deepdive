Former separatist guerrillas in Indonesia's Aceh province will
establish a new political party next month, one of their leaders
said Tuesday.


The party will subsume the rebels' Free Aceh Movement, also known
as GAM, which fought a three-decade insurgency against Indonesian
rule, the leader said.


"GAM members will only have one party," said Tengku Muhammad
Usman Lampoh Awe, the head of the GAM Central Council.


"If there are GAM members who set up other parties, their GAM
membership will be rescinded."


Other parties established by members of the movement would not
represent GAM, he said.


The conflict in Aceh claimed at least 15,000 lives, but GAM
dropped its claim for independence in return for more autonomy
for Aceh under a 2005 peace deal.


The pact was signed after the 2004 Asian tsunami killed 168,000
people in Aceh and forced the rebels and the government to
reassess the conflict.


GAM candidates did unexpectedly well in district and
gubernatorial elections last year. One of its former spokesmen,
Irwandi Yusuf, won the race to become Aceh's governor.


Parliamentary elections are due in the staunchly Muslim province
in 2009 and GAM was expected to build a party to contest them.
Such local political parties are banned elsewhere in Indonesia,
but allowed in Aceh.


Two local parties have been set up in Aceh so far. The Aceh
People's Party was established by former student activists and
the Gabthat Party includes former GAM fighters and activists.
