The New Jersey Devils, who are in first place in the Atlantic
Division with 102 points, fired coach Claude Julien with just
three games left in the regular season.


It was a stunning but not unprecedented move on Tuesday by
general manager Lou Lamoriello, whose overall track record as a
GM is generally unquestioned.


But for the second time in as many National Hockey League
seasons, he will move from the front office to the bench.


After Larry Robinson resigned as coach in December 2005,
Lamoriello took over as interim coach and guided the Devils to a
32-14-4 record and an Atlantic Division title.


The Devils closed the season with an 11-game winning streak and
swept the New York Rangers in the opening round of the playoffs
before losing in five games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion
Carolina Hurricanes.


Lamoriello tabbed Julien as coach last June. He had the club
playing its normally effective defensive style as New Jersey
ranks first in the East with 195 goals allowed.


The Devils (47-24-8) have won four of their last five games and
are coming off a 3-1 victory over Boston on Sunday.


But Lamoriello believed a change was needed. He felt the same way
late in the 1999-00 season when he fired coach Robbie Ftorek and
promoted Robinson, a move that triggered a march to the
franchise's second Stanley Cup.


New Jersey hosts Ottawa on Tuesday before closing the regular
season with contests against Philadelphia on Thursday and the New
York Islanders on Sunday. The Devils are assured of home-ice
advantage in the first round of the postseason.
