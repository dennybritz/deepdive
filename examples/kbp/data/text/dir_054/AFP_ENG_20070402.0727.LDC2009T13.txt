Washington Wizards all-star forward Caron Butler will miss the
next six weeks of the National Basketball Association season with
a fractured right hand, the team announced Monday.


In the third quarter of Sunday's win at Milwaukee, Butler banged
his right hand on the backboard and left the game.  Afterward, he
said it "popped out of place."


Initially thought to be a broken wrist, Butler underwent further
examination that revealled a first metacarpal fracture in his
right hand.


The Wizards (39-33) are on the verge of clinching their third
straight playoff berth and are trying to hold off the Miami Heat
for the Southeast Division title and home-court advantage in the
first round of the postseason.
