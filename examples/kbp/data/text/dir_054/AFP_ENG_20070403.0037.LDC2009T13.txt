All of Mexico City will be one free, wireless Internet hotspot by
2008, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard announced Monday.


The project "will accelerate the technological development of the
city," Ebrard said after signing a contract with the Chinese
telecoms and networking giant ZTE.


The project began as a hook-up for security cameras around the
Mexican capital, he said.


"Why connect 4,000 cameras with fiber (optic cable) if everyone
has wireless?" he said.


"If we are going to deploy 4,000 (security) cameras, I want them
to be Wi-Fi," Ebrard said.
