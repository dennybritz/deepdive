The US military announced on Tuesday the death of three more
soldiers in Iraq, including one killed in a brutal suicide truck
bomb attack in the oil city of Kirkuk a day ago.


The soldier died from wounds when struck by the bomb which
exploded outside a police centre and a primary school in Kirkuk
on Monday, the military said.


Twelve Iraqis, including eight schoolgirls and a toddler, were
also killed in the blast when the bomber carrying food supplies
exploded his vehicle.


Three more US soldiers were wounded in the blast, the military
said.


Another soldier was killed Monday in a roadside bomb blast next
to his vehicle during combat operations near Baghdad, the
military said.


The third soldier was killed in combat operations in the western
Anbar province on Monday, the military reported.


The latest fatalities brought the US military's losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion to 3,253, according to an AFP count
based on Pentagon figures.
