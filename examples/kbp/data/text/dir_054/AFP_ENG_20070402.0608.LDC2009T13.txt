Lloyds TSB, the fifth-biggest bank in Britain, said on Tuesday it
had launched the country's first widely available bank account
for Muslim businesses.


"Thousands of Muslim businesses across Britain will be able to
bank according to their faith from today, as Lloyds TSB launches
the first high street Islamic business account in the country," a
statement said.


"The account, which complies with Islamic law (Sharia), is
available across the bank's 2,000 branches, and will be open to
the UK's estimated 100,000 Muslim firms."


Lloyds' branches in England, Scotland and Wales already offer
current and student accounts which comply with Islamic law while
most of its banks allow Muslims to apply for Islamic home loans.


Lloyds said the launch of the Islamic Business and Corporate
account establishes the bank as the largest provider of Islamic
banking across Britain.    In order to comply with Islamic law,
the business account offers no credit interest or overdraft
facility.
