Thirteen villages have been reported destroyed in the tsunami
which devastated western areas of the Solomon Islands, police
said Tuesday.


A state of emergency was declared late Monday following the
tsunami, which was generated by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake, and
reports of the extent of devastation were starting to trickle in,
they said.


"Virtually all the houses have been destroyed" in the affected
villages, Solomon Islands police spokesman Mick Spinks said. A
top police officer earlier said at least 20 people had been
killed in the tragedy.


Most of the villages were in the Gizo area, just 45 kilometres
(30 miles from the quake epicentre, and in the nearby Shortland
Islands.


The spokesman said it was still difficult to make an accurate
assessment of the damage and casualties.


"There are many, many little islands up there and you just don't
know how many people are resident of the islands," Spinks said.


The Solomon Islands, around 2,600 kilometres (1,600 miles) east
of Australia, have a little over half a million people living on
dozens of islands, while hundreds more are uninhabited.
