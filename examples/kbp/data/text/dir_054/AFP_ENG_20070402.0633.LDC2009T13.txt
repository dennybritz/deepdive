Ukraine's pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on Monday
called on pro- Western President Viktor Yushchenko not to
dissolve parliament, during a crisis meeting of his cabinet.


"The president has a chance to take measures not to allow
Ukraine's destabilisation. First of all, he can refrain from
publishing this decree (dissolving the parliament) and it will
not enter into force," Yanukovych said in televised comments.


"If the president publishes the decree, he will have the chance
to annul it," he added.


Citing the parliament's resolution adopted earlier, which
contained the pro- Russian coalition's concessions to Yushchenko,
Yanukovych suggested that it "gave the chance for (political)
negotiations."
