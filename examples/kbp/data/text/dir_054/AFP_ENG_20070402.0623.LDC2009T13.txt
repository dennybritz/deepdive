The death toll from the tsunami which struck the Solomon Islands
was expected to rise Tuesday as the extent of the devastation in
the isolated Pacific region become known, police said.


Entire villages in the western Solomons were reported to have
been destroyed after a powerful undersea earthquake unleashed the
tsunami Monday.


"Always the optimist, but I expect there will be further deaths
to report as they day progresses unfortunately," deputy Solomons
police commissioner Peter Marshall said.


"Today will be a telling day," Marshall said on Radio New
Zealand.


Marshall said the official police death toll was 12, including
nine people Gizo, the main town in Western Province. Gizo was
just 45 kilometres (28 miles) from the epicentre of Monday
morning's 8.0 magnitude earthquake, which triggered the tsunami.


There have also been reports of unconfirmed deaths and widespread
damage from surrounding islands in Western Province and nearby
Choiseul province.


Solomon Islands police were sending four aircraft into the region
Tuesday to assess the damage and relief needs, Marshall said.


"It is important we don't put everything into one location and
find out that we are in the wrong spot," he said.


Two police patrol boats and a cargo vessel carrying fuel and
relief supplies were due to arrive in Munda, near Gizo, Tuesday
morning.


In Gizo, people from low lying areas took shelter overnight on
higher ground behind the town as aftershocks continued to rock
the area.
