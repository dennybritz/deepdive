A New Zealand man was reported Tuesday to have drowned in the
Solomon Islands tsunami while trying to save his mother from the
surging waves.


New Zealand radio quoted the family of Teangauki Toma, 53, who
was visiting family in the Gizo area, one of the worst hit
regions following Monday morning's 8.0-magnitude earthquake and
subsequent tsunami.


Toma was brought up in the Solomons before moving to New Zealand
34 years ago.


His eldest daughter, Juliette Launiuvao, said he drowned while
trying to save his mother, who was swept away. Toma's body was
found but his mother was still missing, Launiuvao said.


A spokeswoman for New Zealand's foreign affairs ministry said the
death had not yet been confirmed by Solomon Islands police. She
said up to 10 other New Zealanders known to have been in the area
had been accounted for.


Meanwhile, New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters
said the country would make an initial 500,000 dollar (355,000
US) contribution to the Solomon Islands and also provide urgently
needed relief supplies.


He said an air force aircraft had left for the Solomons loaded
with food and other emergency supplies.


"Initial assessments of damage and casualties are continuing but
the available information suggests the situation is grave and
there are thousands of Solomon Islanders requiring urgent
assistance," Peters said.
