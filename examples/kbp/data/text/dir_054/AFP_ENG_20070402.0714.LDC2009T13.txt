More than 18,000 Chinese were killed and over 90,000 injured in
road traffic accidents in the first quarter, state media reported
Tuesday.


The number of road accidents totaled 78,551 in the first quarter
and resulted in the direct loss of 262 million yuan (33.9 million
dollars), the China Youth Daily reported, citing ministry of
public security figures.


More than 60 percent of road accidents involved a collision of
vehicles and speeding was the main cause of accidents, according
to the ministry.


More than 89,000 people were killed in traffic accidents on
China's dangerous roads in 2006, about 245 every day, state media
said earlier this year.


China's roads are among the most dangerous in the world, and the
World Health Organisation has said the Chinese government could
be massively under-reporting road fatalities.


It said there may be more than twice the official number of
deaths, as official figures largely come from police reports and
not from hospitals or medical clinics.
