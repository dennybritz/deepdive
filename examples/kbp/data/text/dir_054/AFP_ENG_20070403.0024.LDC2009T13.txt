The Chicago Cubs learned on the day of their Major League
Baseball season opener that this will be their last one under the
ownership of the Tribune Company.


The media conglomerate announced on Monday that it will sell the
Cubs after the 2007 season. It was also announced that the
Tribune Company will be sold to real estate magnate Sam Zell.


The Tribune had said for months that it would focus on the sale
of the entire company before considering selling individual
pieces, which includes 23 television stations and 11 newspapers,
including the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times.


The Tribune bought the Cubs, who have not won a World Series in
nearly a century, in 1981 for 20.5 million dollars. Now the team
is probably worth more than 500 million dollars.


The Cubs opened the 2007 season under new manager Lou Piniella on
Monday with a 5-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds.
