The Papua New Guinea government was Tuesday scrambling to confirm
reports that a family of five was washed away by a tsunami
spawned by a quake off the Solomon Islands.


The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said a tsunami generated
by Monday's 8.0-magnitude quake hit the family, who lived on a
small island in PNG's southeastern Milne Bay province, 200
kilometers (120 miles) from the temblor.


The tsunami killed at least 22 people and left thousands of
others homeless in the western Solomons, which lie close to the
epicentre off the cost of the western Solomon Islands.


But officials in PNG's office of disaster management told AFP
they were unable to confirm the report and were still waiting for
news from the remote area.


"We have heard the reports but cannot confirm anything as we have
not got any information yet," a spokesman said, declining to be
identified.


Bougainville Affairs Minister Peter Barter told the Australian
Associated Press he was also trying to confirm the reports of the
lost family.


Barter said damage to the mainland of PNG was minimal but that it
was uncertain what damage had been wrought in the Milne Bay area.


"Any damage that would've been done from a tidal wave would've
affected the Milne Bay area and Rossell Island, which is (in the)
direct line of the epicentre," he said.
