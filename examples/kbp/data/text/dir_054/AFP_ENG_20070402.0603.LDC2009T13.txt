The European Commission has accused Apple of braking the law by
charging different prices on its iTunes websites for music
downloads in different countries, a spokesman said on Monday.


The Brussels-based body on Friday sent the US firm and several
music firms a statement of objections, the first step of formal
proceedings, spokesman Jonathan Todd said, confirming a report in
French business daily Les Echos.


The companies have two months to respond in writing to the
commission, the European Union's executive arm, or can request an
audience to defend themselves verbally, said Todd, a spokesman
for EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.


European consumers are only able to download music from the
iTunes site in their country of residence and prices differ from
country to country within the 27-nation European Union. Customers
can only buy songs in the country where their credit card is
registered.


Earlier on Monday music giant EMI said it would offer songs from
its vast stable of artists for download without copy protection
as part of a deal with Apple.
