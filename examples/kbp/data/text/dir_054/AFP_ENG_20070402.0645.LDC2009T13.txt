The Iraqi kidnappers of a German woman and her son have extended
by 10 days their deadline for Berlin to withdraw its forces from
Afghanistan or see the hostages executed, a group monitoring
terrorist websites said Monday.


The deadline extension came in a video that also showed Hannelore
Krause, 61, with her 20-year-old son Sinan as she appealed to her
country and Austria to comply with the demands of her captors,
according to the SITE Institute.


A description of the video by SITE said the previously unknown
Iraqi group called "Arrows of Righteousness" had threatened to
kill the Germans on Monday but ended up "extending the ultimatum
for this withdrawal (from Afghanistan) by 10 days."
