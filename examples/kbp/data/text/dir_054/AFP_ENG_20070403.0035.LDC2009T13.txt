South Asian leaders opened a summit in the Indian capital Tuesday
aimed at injecting new momentum into an underperforming regional
bloc designed to boost trade and cooperation.


The two-day summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) -- which groups countries who account for
nearly 1.5 billion people or one-fifth of humanity -- is set to
be dominated by trade and security issues.


SAARC is made up of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- or half the world's poor.


The summit opened with leaders of the seven countries signing a
declaration that formally brings in Afghanistan as a new member.


Major powers such as China, the European Union, Japan, South
Korea and the United States will be attending as observers. Iran
has also been given preliminary approval to join with observer
status, despite Western obejections.
