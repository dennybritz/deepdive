One of the cars that served as actor David Hasselhoff's
futuristic fast-talking ride named KITT in the 1980s series
"Knight Rider" went on sale Monday, the seller said.


The sticker price on the ebony 1982 Pontiac TransAm is 149,995
dollars at Kassabian Motors in Dublin, California, 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southeast of San Francisco.


Its dashboard is festooned with lights and a welter of buttons.
Flashing red lights snake to and fro on the hood, supposedly
evoking radar.


The talking car KITT, short for "Knight Industries Two Thousand,"
played part friend, part crime-fighting sidekick to Hasselhoff,
who played Michael Knight in the "Knight Rider" series, shown
from 1982 to 1986 in the United States.


"Come take Michael Knight's place behind the wheel of one of the
most famous cars in history!" the seller's website proclaims.


Among its lesser known assets, the two-door coupe has 2,393
original miles, a stunt brake switch, two television sets and
original interior fabric.


It is the "only one of only four surviving T-top cars from the
series," the seller says.
