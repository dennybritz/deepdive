The league-leading Dallas Mavericks, looking for another big body
for the National Basketball Association playoffs, signed 44-year-
old Kevin Willis to a 10-day contract on Monday.


A 20-year veteran, Willis has not played in the NBA since
appearing in 29 games for Atlanta in the 2004-05 season. He had a
reputation as one of the best- conditioned players in the league.


The only player older than Willis to take the court was 46-year-
old Nat Hickey, who played one game for the Providence
Steamrollers in the 1947-48 season. Hall of Fame centre Robert
Parish played until he was 43.


Dallas lost third-string centre D.J. Mbenga to a season-ending
knee injury earlier this season. Mbenga played in last year's NBA
Finals, when the Mavericks matched up against monstrous Miami
centre Shaquille O'Neal.


Willis ran into Mavericks owner Mark Cuban at All-Star Weekend in
Las Vegas, and the men discussed a possible comeback. Willis
would play behind the centre tandem of Erick Dampier and DeSagana
Diop.


Joining his eighth team, Willis has career averages of 12.2
points and 8.4 rebounds in 1,419 games.
