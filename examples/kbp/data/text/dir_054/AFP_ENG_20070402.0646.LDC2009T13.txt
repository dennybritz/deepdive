Ukraine's parliament overnight called on the constitutional court
to rule on the legitimacy of President Viktor Yushchenko's decree
dissolving the parliament, signed late Monday.


In an extraordinary parliament session, 262 lawmakers of the
total 450 voted in favor of calling on the court to examine the
issue within five days, the Interfax news agency reported, adding
that the text of the appeal had not yet been prepared.


The lawmakers then called for a halt in their session until early
Tuesday, though parliament members of the pro-Russian coalition,
currently in conflict with Yushchenko, decided to spend the night
in the parliament building, the agency said.
