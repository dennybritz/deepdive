Mexican police arrested the alleged leader of the Arellano Felix
drug trafficking gang in Tijuana, federal prosecutors said late
Monday.


"Police captured Victor Magno Escobar Luna, alias 'The Cop-
killer,' considered one of the operators of the cartel
(previously) belonging to the Arellano Felix" brothers,
prosecutors said in a statement.


Magno Escobar "is one of the men closest to Javier Arellano
Felix," the statement said.


He was arrested in a house in downtown Tijuana, on the US border.
Police seized AK-47 assault rifles, a 9mm Glock pistol, bullet-
proof vests and pick-up trucks, the statement said.


Javier Arellano Felix, once the head of the Tijuana cartel, was
arrested in August 2006 by the US Coast Guard while fishing in
international waters off Baja California.
