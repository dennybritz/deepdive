A US air strike destroyed two large buildings south of the Iraqi
capital used to manufacture and store explosives, the military
said on Tuesday.


"Ground forces called in for air support when they found large
amounts of chemicals and improvised-explosive-device making
materials in two buildings," in the town of Arab Jubur, south of
Baghdad, it said.


The air strike caused no casualties, it added.


Since the launch of a massive security operation in Baghdad in
February, Iraqi and US troops have reduced execution-style
killings in the capital, but car bombings carried out by
suspected Sunni militants remain a major headache.


In a bid to stop the flow of explosives into the city, the
military is now focusing on detecting bomb-making facilities,
which are believed to be largely located on the outskirts of
Baghdad.
