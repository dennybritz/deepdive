A powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit the Hindu Kush region of
northeast Afghanistan on Tuesday, the US Geological Survey said,
putting its depth at some 200 kilometres (125 miles) underground.


The quake struck near Feyzabad in the northeast and was felt 260
kilometres away in the capital Kabul and in neighbouring western
Pakistan.


It was not immediately clear if it had caused damage or
casualties.
