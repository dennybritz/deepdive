Sri Lankan troops killed at least 12 Tamil Tiger rebels in
clashes in the northwestern district of Mannar, the defence
ministry said Tuesday.


The clashes erupted near the Giant's Tank area late on Sunday, it
said in a statement issued after rebels were blamed for the
bombing of a bus on Monday which killed 16 people.


"Intercepted LTTE communication confirmed their total losses as
12," the ministry said in a statement. "No harm was reported to
the security forces. A search operation is in progress in the
area."


Police said an investigation was underway over Monday's bus
bombing.


Passengers were getting off the bus to be checked by troops
manning a road block when the blast occurred just outside the
town of Ampara, 350 kilometres (220 miles) east of Colombo.


Tiger rebels denied involvement in the bombing.


The Tamil rebels have waged a 35-year campaign for independence
that has claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
