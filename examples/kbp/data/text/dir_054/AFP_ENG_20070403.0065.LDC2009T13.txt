A bishop and three of his congregants were among those killed
when a tsunami slammed into the Solomon Islands, devastating a
church during an ordination ceremony, his church said Tuesday.


Bishop Rowlington Zappo was presiding over the ceremony on the
island of Simbo, not far from Gizo, which lies near the epicentre
of Monday's 8.0-magnitude quake that triggered the tsunami.


A spokesman for the United Church said the Anglican bishop and
three of his worshippers died when the wave struck, while other
members of the 100-strong congregation survived.


"I believe those are the circumstances of his death," the
spokesman said.


The bishop had arrived on Simbo, one of 16 islands in the New
Georgia group, after a 90-minute motor canoe trip from the island
of Gizo, which was badly damaged in the quake that killed at
least 24 people in the Solomons.


Church leaders had travelled to the bishop's home island for his
burial on Tuesday, the spokesman said.
