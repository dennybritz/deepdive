Sri Lanka's state institutions have been asked to uphold native
culture and banish foreign food at official functions, the public
administration ministry said Tuesday.


Receptionists have been asked to greet guests in the traditional
"ayubowan" ("may you live long") after offering local sweetmeats
made with coconut, rice flour and usually fried in coconut oil.


"Every officer in telephone exchanges in all public
institutions... should as appropriate to the situation answer
telephone calls with the words Ayubowan in Sinhala, Vanakkam in
Tamil and Assalam Alaikkum for Muslims," the ministry said.


"All institutions in the public sector should take (the) action
as a pioneer step in the vast effort of inculcating into the
minds of masses the Sri Lankan traditional ethics and customs,"
the ministry said.


It said indigenous food must be served to guests instead of the
more easily available imported snacks.


"The reality is that it is not possible for a country to
safeguard the real benefits of development outside the cultural
elements unique to any country," the ministry said.


Last month, Sri Lanka banned the use of naked or semi-naked
models in advertising, saying it was seeking to protect those
offended by public nudity.
