Thirteen villages have been reported destroyed in the tsunami
which devastated western areas of the Solomon Islands, police
said Tuesday.


A state of emergency was declared late Monday following the
tsunami, which was generated by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake, and
reports of the extent of devastation were starting to trickle in,
police said.


"Virtually all the houses have been destroyed" in the affected
villages, Solomon Islands police spokesman Mick Spinks said. A
top police officer earlier said at least 20 people had been
killed in the tragedy.
