A strong 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit off Indonesia's northern
Sulawesi province on Tuesday, geologists said, but there were no
immediate reports of casualties or damage.


The quake struck overnight around 90 kilometres (55 miles)
northeast of Bitung, the main port in North Sulawesi province,
the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said.


Ali Imran from the agency said that the quake struck at a depth
of 95 kilometers (60 miles) kilometres.


It was felt moderately in Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi
just 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Bitung.


The Indonesian archipelago sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire"
where continental plates meet, causing frequent seismic and
volcanic activity.
