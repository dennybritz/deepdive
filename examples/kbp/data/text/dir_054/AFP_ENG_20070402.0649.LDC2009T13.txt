At least 20 people were killed in the tsunami and huge earthquake
that devastated the western Solomon Islands and many more are
missing, a top police officer said Tuesday.


"We are now of a view that here are about 20 confirmed dead
overall, but I am rather fearful that the number will increase
today as we get around the various locations," said Solomons
Deputy Police Commissioner Peter Marshall.


He said "many more" people were missing following Monday's double
disaster, in which entire villages were destroyed after a
magnitude 8.0 quake sparked a tidal wave that hit towns in the
country's Western Province.


Sky news in Australia reported that hundreds of people were
missing after the town of Gizo was pounded first by the
earthquake, which had its epicentre just 40 kilometers (25 miles)
away, and then by the wave.


"The main number of the deaths were in Gizo, where a number of
villages were affected," he said, referring to the seaside
community of around 20,000 people which is popular with scuba
divers.


Authorities had late Monday estimated the death toll to be at
least 15.
