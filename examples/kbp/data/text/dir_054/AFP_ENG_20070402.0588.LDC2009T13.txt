Britain said it agreed with Iran's top security official Ali
Larijani when he called for a diplomatic solution to the case of
15 captured Royal Navy personnel in Iran, a foreign ministry
spokeswoman told AFP on Monday.


Larijani, the head of the supreme national security council,
earlier told Britain's Channel Four television that there was "no
need" for a trial to resolve the impasse between the two
countries, and added that the stand-off was "quite resolvable."


"We are still studying Dr Larijani's remarks," the spokeswoman
said.


"There remain some differences between us, but we can confirm we
share his preference for early bilateral discussions to find a
diplomatic solution to this problem.


"We will be following up with the Iranian authorities tomorrow
given our shared desire to make early progress."


Larijani's comments followed claims from Iran that all 15
detainees -- 14 men and one woman -- have now confessed to
illegally entering Iranian waters.


"Definitely our priority is to solve the problem through proper
diplomatic channels. We are not interested in having this issue
get further complicated," Larijani said.


"We definitely believe that this issue can be resolved. And there
is no need for any trial."
