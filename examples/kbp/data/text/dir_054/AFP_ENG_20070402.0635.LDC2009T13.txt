Ukraine's army will obey President Viktor Yushchenko, who
dissolved the country's parliament Monday, Defense Minister
Anatoly Grytsenko said during an urgent government meeting
overnight.


"The armed forces will follow the commander-in-chief's orders,"
said Grytsenko, a firm Yushchenko supporter and the last pro-
Western hawk in a government formed almost entirely by the pro-
Russian parliamentary coalition.
