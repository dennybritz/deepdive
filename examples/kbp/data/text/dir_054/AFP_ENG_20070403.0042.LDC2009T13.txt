Thailand's army-installed premier vowed Tuesday he would "call
the shots" so long as he remained in office after he publicly
disagreed with the junta chief's hopes to extend emergency rule.


"I can make decisions on my own judgement. I'm not going to
follow any pressures," Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said on a
visit to Tokyo.


"It's maybe different on various issues. Just like my foreign
minister will have a different opinion, my deputy prime minister
will have a different opinion," he said, pointing to his advisers
at a press conference.


"But I'm the one who calls the shots. That I can say. If not, I'm
not going to be in this position," Surayud said.


General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who led September's coup that
ousted elected prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and installed
Surayud, last week called for emergency rule in Bangkok to crack
down on swelling anti-junta protests.


But Surayud, a retired general sometimes described as the more
gentle face of the coup leaders, rejected extending emergency
rule and pledged to hold elections in December


"You may think this interim government is a military government.
That is not true," Surayud said.


"I was appointed as the prime minister and I select all my
ministers by myself. Nobody else got involved," he said. "I will
make my own decisions."


The junta deposed Thaksin, a populist self-made tycoon, citing
allegations of corruption. The junta has refused to rule out the
possibility of more coups in the future.
