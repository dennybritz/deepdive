The former coach of Malaysia's national football team was found
guilty of match- fixing in Singapore on Tuesday.


Chow Kwai Lam was convicted after a trial in Singapore's
Subordinate Court. The charge related to his time as coach of a
Singapore club.


"I reject your defence that you had no corrupt intent," District
Judge Jasvender Kaur told Chow.


She said she accepted the testimony of Zulkifli Zainolabidin, a
former goalkeeper of Singapore club Paya Lebar-Punggol FC.


Zulkifli had testified that Chow offered him 200-300 Singapore
dollars (131-197 US) as advance payment for letting the
opposition score two or three goals during a match in 2005, and
an unspecified amount after.


"This young man... has no reason to have spun a story against
you," the judge said.


Chow testified that he was only trying to test Zulkifli's
integrity by asking if he was interested in letting in goals. He
said there was no mention of money or a number of goals to be let
in, but Kaur rejected this argument.


The judge increased his bail to 30,000 dollars and allowed Chow,
a Malaysian, to visit Kuala Lumpur ahead of his sentencing
hearing on April 10.


He faces up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of 100,000
dollars.
