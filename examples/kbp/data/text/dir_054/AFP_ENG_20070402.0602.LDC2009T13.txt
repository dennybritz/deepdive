Ukraine's parliament on Monday voted to dismiss the central
electoral commission and refused to allot funds for early
elections, defying President Viktor Yushchenko's decision to
dissolve it.


Of the parliament's 450 lawmakers, 261 voted in favor of the
resolution which calls for "an interruption of the powers of the
central electoral commission's members" during an extraordinary
session broadcast live on television.


The same number of lawmakers voted for another text forbidding to
allot funds for early parliamentary elections, set by Yushchenko
for May 27, the Interfax news agency reported.
