The United States Monday urged Ukraine's political leaders to
stay calm and respect the rule of law amid turmoil triggered by
President Viktor Yushchenko's move to dissolve parliament and
call snap elections.


State Department spokesman Sean McCormack made the plea as
thousands of protesters rallied in Kiev against the pro-Western
Yushchenko's leadership and Ukraine legislators voted to defy his
decision.


"The United States calls on all Ukrainian political leaders to
take full responsibility for their supporters' actions and to
maintain calm," McCormack said in a statement.


"We are monitoring closely developments in Ukraine and urge all
parties to respect the rule of law and resolve disputes
nonviolently, in a manner consistent with Ukraine's democratic
values and national interests."


Yushchenko, who came to power in the so-called "orange
revolution" of 2004, capped months of political tensions in
Ukraine by announcing he had dissolved parliament and set new
elections for May 27.
