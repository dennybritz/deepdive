A leader of a Palestinian militant group was seriously wounded on
Tuesday in exchanges of fire with Israeli troops in the West Bank
town of Nablus, Palestinian medical sources said.


Ahmad Sanakra, 22, a top leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades,
a group loosely affiliated to the moderate Fatah movement,
sustained two bullets in a gun battle with Israeli troops in the
Balata refugee camp, they said.


"Palestinians opened fire on a force operating in Nablus, which
returned fire and identified hitting one person," the Israeli
army said.


According to Palestinian sources, Sanakra has been injured three
times in the past by Israeli fire.
