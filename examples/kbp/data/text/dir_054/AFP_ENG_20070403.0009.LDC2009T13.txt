Japan said Tuesday it wants to breathe new life into moribund
free-trade talks with South Korea, a day after its Asian
neighbour struck a landmark deal with the United States.


"Japan has continuously appealed to South Korea to reopen
negotiations, including at a summit level," said Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki.


"Japan would like to increase its efforts towards South Korea to
reopen the (free-trade) negotiations as early as possible," he
added.


Working-level talks between Tokyo and Seoul on a bilateral free
trade pact have been suspended since November 2004, largely due
to South Korea's demands that Japan open up 90 percent of its
tightly protected agricultural market.


South Korea on Monday reached a free trade agreement with the
United States that scraps tariffs on thousands of items.


The agreement, which needs legislative approval in both
countries, gives South Korea an edge in the US market over its
Asian competitors including Japan, China and Taiwan.


The trade deal is the biggest for the US since the North American
Free Trade Agreement in 1993 and its first with a major Asian
economy, but needs to be approved by Democrat-controlled Congress
which is generally opposed.


Japan and South Korea have been seeking bilateral free trade
agreements amid a breakdown in global trade liberalisation talks.
