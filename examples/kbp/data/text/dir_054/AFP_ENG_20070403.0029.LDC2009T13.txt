China plans to extend its oil and gas pipelines by nearly 60
percent by 2010 in a bid to meet the country's rising demand for
energy, state media reported Tuesday.


A preliminary study is being conducted on the second West-East
gas pipeline, said Tang Yali, vice president of the natural gas
and pipeline company under the nation's largest oil producer
PetroChina, according to the China Daily.


"The total investment for the pipeline is projected to cross 100
billion yuan (12.9 billion dollars)," Tang said.


He said the pipeline is expected to transmit 30 billion cubic
metres (1.1 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas a year.


The new pipeline is likely to transmit natural gas from the gas-
rich Xinjiang region in the northwest to the southern province of
Guangdong, he said.


In 2004, China completed its first West-East gas pipeline, one of
the biggest energy projects in the country, linking Xinjiang and
the industrialised eastern coast.


The country has built more than 80,000 kilometres (49,600 miles)
of oil and gas pipelines, the sixth longest in the world, the
China Daily said.


Natural gas output in China in 2006 reached 58.6 billion cubic
metres, up 16.9 percent over the previous year but growing slower
than the 20.6 percent in 2005, the report said.
