Suspected Islamic rebels have shot dead three Muslims in
Thailand's restive south, where separatist violence continues to
spiral, police said Tuesday.


Two men on a motorcycle sprayed a 27-year-old Muslim villager
with bullets as he sat in front of his house in Narathiwat
province Monday night, killing him instantly, police said.


Early Tuesday in the same province, suspected militants opened
fire on a motorcycle, killing its passenger, a Muslim man. The
driver was unharmed.


In nearby Yala province, a woman died in hospital Tuesday after
an attack on her family the previous day. Her husband and seven-
year-old son were also injured when separatists shot at their
pick-up truck as they drove home.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in Muslim-majority
southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani since the
latest separatist insurgency erupted in January 2004.


The violence has worsened since a coup last year, despite a
series of peace initiatives by the army-installed government.
