The Chinese government has launched a one-year nationwide
crackdown on abuse in the country's property market, state media
reported Tuesday.


The Ministry of Construction and seven other central government
agencies will carry out probes into graft, bribery and other
abuses in the market from late April, the China Securities
Journal said.


In a policy outline posted on its website, the ministry said that
all real estate projects already under construction, or at the
pre-sale stage, will be the inital focus of the investigations.


The government aims to stamp out misconduct at all stages of
development, and will also include probes into the actions of
government officials.
