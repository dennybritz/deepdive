The Japanese president of a controversial company controlled by
Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church was kidnapped in Paraguay
along with his secretary, police said Monday.


Kidnappers demanded 250,000 dollars to release Hirokazu Ota, 62,
the president of Victoria S.A., and his secretary Sawako
Takayama, also a Japanese national, police said.


They also seized a policeman and his girlfriend who by chance
witnessed the kidnapping in Caaguazu, about 200 kilometers (120
miles) east of the capital.


Japan's Kyodo news agency reported that Paraguayan police have
arrested several people in connection with the kidnapping, but
said it is not known whether the abductees are safe.


Victoria manages land assets in Paraguay owned by the South
Korea-based Unification Church, and has sparked controversy for
several years for buying up huge swathes of land in the Chaco
region in the country's center.


In Tokyo the Japanese foreign ministry declined to comment on the
case "due to its sensitive nature," a ministry official said.


Ota has been engaged in activities of the Unification church for
about 10 years both in Japan and Paraguay, Jiji Press said.
