Roadside bombings killed three Iraqi civilians in Baghdad on
Tuesday, security officials said, as insurgents defied an ongoing
Iraqi and US military crackdown in the war-torn capital.


Two people travelling in a car through the southwestern Baghdad
district of Saydiya were killed when a bomb exploded. Another two
people were wounded in the attack, officials said.


A civilian was killed and three wounded when a second roadside
bomb exploded in the middle of the Al-Kubaisi shopping centre in
Zafaraniya, in southern Baghdad, the same sources said.


South of the capital, gunmen shot dead a policeman in the Al-Hay
district of Kut, according to police.
