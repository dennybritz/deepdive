South Korea's LG Electronics said Tuesday it had reached an out-
of-court settlement in patent law suits against two Taiwanese
computer makers.


LG said it had decided to drop the law suits in return for
unspecified amount of royalty payments from the two companies --
Compal Electronics and First International Computer (FIC).


LG Electronics had filed patent law suits against the Taiwanese
companies with a US court in 2000, arguing that COMPAL and FIC
had sold computers in the US market that use the data-
transmitting technology without its permission.


The dispute has been centered on an industry-standard technology
required for effective data transfer between computer
motherboards and peripheral devices, which is fundamental to the
operation of computers.


"Intellectual property is one of LG's essential assets. We will
always fight to protect it," Lee Jeong-Hwan, executive vice
president and head of LG Electronics Intellectual Property Center
said.


LG said the settlement would have a positive impact on its
negotiations with other PC makers, adding that the technology in
question is worth more than 200 million dollars.


LG has already concluded royalty contracts with 10 other PC
makers using the same technology. It is now seeking similar deals
with 30 others.


LG holds around 2,000 PC-related patents.
