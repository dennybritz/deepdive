An anonymous buyer paid more than 2.7 million dollars Monday for
a Stradivari violin, believed to be the second highest amount
ever paid at auction for a musical instrument.


The 1729 instrument, known as the "Solomon, ex-Lambert," was
snapped up at Christie's in New York by a private buyer who
wished to remain anonymous, but his agent insisted the instrument
would be loaned out to deserving artists.


The 2.7 million dollar price tag was well above the 1.0-1.5
million dollar estimate. Last year, Christie's sold another
Stradivari, known as "The Hammer," for a record 3.5 million
dollars.


The Solomon, ex-Lambert was previously owned by the late Seymour
Solomon, co- founder of Vanguard records and an amateur
violinist, who bought the violin at auction in 1972 for 17,500
pounds (roughly 44,000 dollars at the time.)


Before that it was owned by Miss Murray Lambert, a British
concert violinist during the 1920 and 30s.


Works by Antonio Stradivari, an Italian instrument maker whose
career spanned the 17th and 18th centuries, are prized for their
tone by international artists including Anne-Sophie Mutter,
Joshua Bell and Maxim Vengerov.
