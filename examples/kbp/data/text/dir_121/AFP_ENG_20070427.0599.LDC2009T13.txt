Shaun Murphy booked his ticket into the last eight with an
impressive 13-8 win over John Parrott at the snooker world
championships here on Friday.


The pair were all square at 8-8 going into the last session when
Murphy fired in a 131 clearance and then another 60 to go 10-8 up
and the 2005 winner went on to take the next three frames to
clinch the win.


Murphy said he had to hit top gear against Parrott after going
into the final session level.


"I just decided to go for it and obviously it paid off," said
Murphy, who will now meet either Matthew Stevens or Mark Allen.


"My mate Richard told me to go back to playing the way I did when
I was 11. It worked but every credit to John.


"I knew it would be tough but he really pushed me hard."


Parrott said nerves had played a part, the 1991 winner telling
the BBC: "It's been a very long time since I've been that
nervous. I felt as though I'd got a family of ferrets in my
waistcoat."
