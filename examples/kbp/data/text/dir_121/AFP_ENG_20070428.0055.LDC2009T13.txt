Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas met Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Saturday to discuss the latest developments in the
violence-stricken Gaza Strip, the official MENA agency said.


The two leaders discussed "the situation on the Palestinian front
and the explosive security situation in the Gaza Strip," MENA
said.


Earlier Saturday, Israeli troops shot dead three members of the
Islamist Hamas's armed wing and wounded a fourth in the Gaza
Strip, a Palestinian medical source and the Israeli army said.


Saturday's deaths brought to 5,673 the number of people killed
since the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in
2000, the majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP
tally.


On Tuesday, the Qassam Brigades declared a five-month truce with
Israel over after Israeli raids killed nine Palestinians last
week.


"The only way to stop this aggression is to return to a complete
calm in Gaza, then in the West Bank," Abbas was quoted as saying.


"This had been agreed but unfortunately it was violated by Israel
and also by the Palestinian side, leading to this escalation,"
Abbas said.


On Friday, Abbas held rare talks with exiled Hamas political
chief Khaled Meshaal in Cairo and agreed to abide by the
ceasefire.
