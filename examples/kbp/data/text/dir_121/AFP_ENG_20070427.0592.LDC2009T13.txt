Disgraced former Italian champions Juventus moved a step closer
to a swift return to the top flight with a 1-0 Serie B victory at
Verona on Friday.


French defender Jean-Alain Boumsong scored the only goal in the
43rd minute, heading home Alessandro Del Piero's corner kick.


The Turin-based side top the table with 72 points from their 35
matches played, eight ahead of Genoa who climbed above Napoli
into second place after their 2-1 win at home to Treviso.


Napoli, who have 62 points, can reclaim the runners-up spot if
they win their home match against Cesena on Saturday.


The top two in the second division win automatic promotion to
Serie A.


Juve coach Didier Deschamps admitted his team performed below
their best.


"We weren't as good as we have been in recent weeks, but I felt
we had a bit extra to give than Verona and deserved the three
points," said the Frenchman.


"Now we are in the final straight and eight points from our final
seven matches should be enough to secure promotion."


Last summer Juventus were demoted from Serie A and given a nine-
point handicap in Serie B for their role in the Italian match-
fixing scandal.
