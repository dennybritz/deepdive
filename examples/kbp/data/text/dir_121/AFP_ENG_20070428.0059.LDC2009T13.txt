A rare moderate earthquake measuring 4.7 hit southern Britain
early Saturday, the US government reported.


The epicenter of the tremor, which occurred at 8:18 am local time
(0718 GMT), was located 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of the
city of Canterbury, according to the US Geological Survey.


The depth of the epicenter was put at 7.1 kilometers (4.4 miles).


There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.


The reading was based on the open-ended Moment Magnitude scale,
now used by US seismologists, which measures the area of the
fault that ruptured and the total energy released.
