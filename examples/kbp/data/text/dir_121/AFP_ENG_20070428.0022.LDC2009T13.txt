The Indonesian island of Bali was Saturday set to welcome
parliamentarians from across the world for the 116th assembly of
the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the secretary general of the
group said, with climate change at the top of the agenda.


"We will have a debate, with global warming as the backdrop,"
Swede Anders Johnsson told AFP, adding that he hoped that
politicians and their governments would take up the issue.


Founded in 1889 and based in Geneva, the IPU, which is seen as
one of the world's leading political organisation, is affiliated
with 148 national parliaments and seven regional parliaments.


"We hope that many of the legislators will return to their
countries and be active (on the subject of climate change)," he
said. "It is important to be even more aggressive on these
issues."


The presence of the US military in Iraq would also be under
discussion, added Johnsson.


Around 1,300 delegates of the IPU, including 700 legislators from
around the world, were due to meet in Bali. The meeting will be
opened Sunday by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.
