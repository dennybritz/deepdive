Carlos Edwards produced a stunning late goal to lift Sunderland
to a 3-2 win over Burnley and one step closer to a return to the
Premiership here on Friday.


Roy Keane's Black Cats moved four points above third-placed Derby
in the Championship after Edwards' effort 10 minutes clinched a
vital three points.


Daryl Murphy gave them the lead in the 14th minute before David
Connolly had a penalty saved five minutes later.


Andy Gray levelled for Burnley before the break with a spot kick
and the visitors took control with Wade Elliott's long-range shot
in the 50th minute.


But Connolly converted the third penalty of the game four minutes
later to put Keane's high achievers back on level pegging before
Edwards popped up 10 minutes from time.


The five-goal thriller was watched by 44,448 supporters - the
biggest crowd of the Championship season.
