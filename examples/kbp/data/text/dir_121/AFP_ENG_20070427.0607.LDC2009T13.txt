Golden State Warriors forward Stephen Jackson was fined 50,000
dollars by the National Basketball Association on Friday for his
response to his ejection from a playoff game on Wednesday.


The volatile forward was tossed with 4:34 left in the fourth
quarter of the Warriors' second first-round game against Dallas.


At first, Jackson took the ejection in stride but grew
increasingly angry and refused to leave the court. Matt Barnes
eventually escorted Jackson to the locker room while trying to
cover Jackson's face with a towel.


Acquired in an eight-player trade from Indiana in January,
Jackson has feuded with coaches in the past.


He also had run-ins with law and received probation for his
involvement in the 2004 brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills.


Jackson's teammate, Baron Davis, was also ejected from
Wednesday's game with two-tenths of second left in the third
quarter after picking up two technical fouls.


The eighth-seeded Warriors, who are in the playoffs for the first
time since 1994, went into Friday's game three tied with the top-
seeded Mavericks at one game each in the best-of-seven series.
