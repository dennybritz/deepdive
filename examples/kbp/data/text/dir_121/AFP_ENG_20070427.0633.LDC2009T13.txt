Vehicle-theft charges against Daniel Baldwin have been dropped
after a friend said he had given permission for the actor to use
a car later reported stolen, prosecutors said Friday.


Baldwin, a brother of actors William, Alec, and Stephen, faced
felony charges of vehicle theft and receiving stolen property
following an incident in Orange County, southern California last
November.


A friend of the actor, Kenneth Smith, had initially reported the
vehicle, a GMY Yukon, stolen. However he later said he had given
Baldwin permission to take the vehicle.


Smith had accompanied Baldwin to court in February to testify
before a judge, but prosecutors wanted more time to check his
statements, the Orange County District Attorney's Office said
Friday.


After reviewing the evidence prosecutors went to court Friday to
dismiss the charges, prosecutors said.
