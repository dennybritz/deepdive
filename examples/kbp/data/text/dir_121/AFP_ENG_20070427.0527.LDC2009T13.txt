South Africa's Team Shosholoza and France's Areva Challenge were
the main winners and losers at the Louis Vuitton Cup here on
Friday.


The pair met in round 11 of the first stage of the round robin
matches with Areva holding a 100 metre cushion at the finish only
for the hapless French to get disqualified on a technicality.


"All their boat hadn't crossed the (virtual finish) line, the top
of their mast didn't pass on the right side of the line," a
spokesman for the race committee explained.


Areva, who earlier had seen off United Internet Team Germany,
remain in eighth in the standings after this sixth defeat, one
place behind Team Shosholoza.


The five favourites to emerge from the round robin stage and into
the semi- finals of this America's Cup qualifying competition -
BMW Oracle, Emirates Team New Zealand, Luna Rossa and Desafio
Espanol - all had an unscheduled day off as the lack of wind
forced a total of six races to be held over until Saturday.


The Louis Vuitton standings are headed by America's Oracle,
unbeaten after 10 races, with the Kiwis three points adrift with
Luna Rossa and Desafio Espanol sharing third one point further
back.
