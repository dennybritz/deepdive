England's Stuart Little led the rain-hit Spanish Open by one shot
with an eight- under par total of 136 after the incomplete second
round on Friday.


The 39-year-old left hander, who because of the bad weather
played both his first and second rounds Friday, was being chased
by compatriots Nick Dougherty and Mark Foster and South Africa's
Charl Schwaterzel.


But after a 100-minute rain delay followed the almost eight hours
of golf lost on Thursday most of the 155-strong field had still
to reach the halfway point.


Those who will have to complete their second rounds early
Saturday include Ryder Cup duo Paul McGinley and Darren Clarke,
two under and three over respectively after the first round.


"This is only my fifth tournament of the year, so to play like
this so far is absolutely fantastic - of course it is," said
Little, runner-up to John Bickerton in Tenerife two seasons ago.
