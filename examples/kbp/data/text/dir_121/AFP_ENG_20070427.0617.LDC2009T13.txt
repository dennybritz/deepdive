The US State Department announced Friday that Randall Tobias, the
embattled head of the US Agency for International Development
(USAID), was resigning for personal reasons.


Tobias said "that he must step down" from his post "effective
immediately," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in a
statement.


"He is returning to private life for personal reasons," the
statement read.


Tobias took the job 14 months ago, replacing Andrew Natsios.


His tenure was strongly criticized in a hearing in the US House
of Representatives in March, especially by Democrat Tom Lantos,
who was angered by USAID's role in the West Bank and Gaza, Russia
and India.


Until he took the USAID post in January 2006, Tobias was
responsible for coordinating the US government's international
HIV/AIDS assistance efforts.


Before entering government Tobias served as chairman, president
and chief executive of the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and
Company.


USAID, founded in 1961, is the US government agency in charge of
sending humanitarian aid in disaster situations around the world.
