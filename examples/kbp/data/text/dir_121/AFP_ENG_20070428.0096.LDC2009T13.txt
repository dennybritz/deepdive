Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived in Saudi Arabia on
Saturday on the first leg of a Middle East tour aimed at
bolstering Japan's presence in a region crucial for its energy
needs.


Abe, who arrived from the United States and talks with President
George W. Bush, is to hold talks with King Abdullah and Crown
Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, who is also defence minister.


His visit comes just a day after the oil-rich kingdom said it had
arrested a ring of alleged Al-Qaeda militants plotting airborne
attacks on oil facilities and army bases, underscoring Japanese
worries about stability in the region.
