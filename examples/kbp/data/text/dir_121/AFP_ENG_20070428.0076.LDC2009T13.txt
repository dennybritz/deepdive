Two Peruvians have been arrested at Bangkok's international
airport trying to smuggle two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of cocaine
hidden in their stomachs, Thai Customs said Saturday.


Customs officers discovered about 250 capsules of the drug,
valued at 223,000 dollars, using X-rays and later recovered it
from the men's faeces.


Luis Alberto Quispe Pina, 39, and Victor Martin Pulache Paim, 21,
who arrived from Buenos Aires via Kuala Lumpur on Friday, have
been charged with drug trafficking.
