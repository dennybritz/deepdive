A man killed in rioting sparked by the removal of a Soviet-era
monument in the Estonian capital this week was a Russian
national, the Russian foreign ministry said Saturday.


"At first the Estonian authorities answered official enquiries by
insisting that none of our citizens were among the injured. It
later became clear that a Russian citizen had died," the foreign
ministry said in a statement.


Estonian officials earlier said a 20-year-old identified only as
Dmitri was stabbed to death overnight Thursday in riots over the
removal of a Soviet war memorial.


It was unclear whether the ministry statement referred to the
same man.


The foreign ministry statement accused Estonian law enforcement
of "excessive force used against demonstrators defending a
memorial to those who fought against fascism."


About 600 rioters, many of them drunken Russians teenagers, have
been detained in the worst unrest to rock Tallinn since Estonia
regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, officials
said.


The Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial is seen by Estonians as a
symbol of 50 years of Soviet occupation following World War II.


Russia considers it a sacred memorial to the Red Army soldiers
who defeated Nazism, and has threatened Tallinn with diplomatic
and economic retaliation.
