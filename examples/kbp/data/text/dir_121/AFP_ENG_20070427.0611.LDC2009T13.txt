The White House on Friday stuck by its conditions for direct
talks with Iran after Europe's foreign policy chief urged
Washington to "open a channel of communication" with Tehran on
all subjects.


"The United States has offered to have talks with Iran for the
first time in 27 years if they will suspend their enrichment and
reprocessing activity," said national security spokesman Gordon
Johndroe.


The European Union's top negotiator in the dispute over the
Islamic republic's nuclear programs, Javier Solana, said earlier
that: "At this point in time to have also the USA open a channel
of communication with Iran would be worth thinking about ... on
everything."


"We have to see how much the USA are ready to engage," he said.


Solana and Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani held talks
in Ankara on Wednesday and Thursday amid a stalemate between
Tehran and Britain, France and Germany -- the "EU-3" -- in the
nuclear dispute.


"We appreciate the good work of the EU and our EU3 partners and
their efforts to get Iran to comply with the international
community," said Johndroe.
