Wellington Hurricanes lock Jason Eaton has been added to a
growing list of injured All Blacks second-rowers after being
ruled out of rugby for six months with a knee injury.


Eaton ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
when he fell awkwardly during the Hurricanes' 22-21 win over the
Otago Highlanders on  Friday night.


He becomes the third All Blacks lock after Chris Jack and James
Ryan to be seriously injured during this year's Super 14
competition.


A Hurricanes spokesman said Saturday that the 24-year-old Eaton
would require a total reconstruction of the ligament and would be
out of action for six months.


"Obviously I'm very disappointed," Eaton said.


"I'm seeing a surgeon next week and we will take things from
there. My focus will be on getting through the rehab work so that
I'm in good shape for the start of the 2008 Super 14."


Like Ryan, Eaton has no chance of making the All Blacks for the
World Cup in France in September.


Ryan was ruled out this month after suffering a serious knee
injury while playing for the Highlanders.


Jack, New Zealand's most experienced lock, remains sidelined
after injuring a hamstring tendon last month.


He is hoping to rejoin the Canterbury Crusaders if they make the
Super 14 final in three weeks.
