Israel is to confiscate 23 hectares (57 acres) of Palestinian
farmland in the occupied West Bank for its controversial security
barrier, according to a military order seen by AFP on Saturday.


The army on Friday told the village council in Bardaleh, north of
the city of Jericho, that the land would be confiscated "for
security reasons" in order to extend the barrier Israel says
stops suicide bombers.


Those who own or use the land are invited to apply for
compensation, said the order a copy of which was given to AFP by
Bardaleh council.


The Israeli army declined to comment on the seizure, but a senior
Palestinian official criticised it.


"We strongly condemn this decision and we call on Israel to
cancel it immediately," said Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian
negotiator.


Israel says the 700 kilometre (435 mile) long barrier, made up of
concrete walls and razor wire fences, is necessary to protect the
Jewish state against terrorists.


Palestinians say the barrier is a land grab which eats up chunks
of their promised state, separates farmers from their land and
splits families.


The International Court of Justice, in a non-binding decision,
ruled the barrier illegal in 2004. Israel has pressed on with
construction, which is 65 percent finished.
