A bomb exploded at an international airport in northwest Pakistan
on Saturday causing slight damage to the building, officials
said.


It was a low intensity timed device planted outside a cafe near
the entrance to the departure lounge at Peshawar International
Airport, area police officer Iftikhar Khan said.


Peshawar is the capital of North West Frontier Province bordering
Afghanistan.


"There were two international flights taking off for the Middle
East and the bomb explosion caused slight damage and panic among
the visitors," Khan told AFP, adding that an inquiry has been
ordered how the explosive was smuggled into the airport.


Pakistan has been hit by a wave of bomb blasts this year
including an attack by an Islamic militant at Islamabad
International Airport in February in which the attacker was
killed and three policemen wounded.
