European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana called on
Friday for the United States to open a "channel of communication"
with Iran on all subjects.


"I think that at this point in time to have also the USA open a
channel of communication with Iran would be worth thinking about
... on everything," Solana said after talks on Tehran's nuclear
programme with the country's top negotiator Ali Larijani this
week.


"We have to see how much the USA are ready to engage," he said.


Solana and Larijani held talks in Ankara on Wednesday and
Thursday, their first face-to-face meetings since the UN Security
Council imposed a second round of limited sanctions on Iran in
March over Tehran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment.


Washington accuses Iran of aiming to develop nuclear weapons and
of supporting insurgents in Iraq.
