Insurgents killed four employees from the Iraqi Red Crescent and
six others in three separate attacks in Baghdad's southern
districts on Saturday, a security official said.


Four Iraqi humanitarian workers were killed and three others
wounded when gunmen ambushed their minibus in the capital's mixed
Sunni-Shiite district of Zafaraniyah, the official said.


No other details were immediately available of the attack, he
said.


Also in Zafaraniyah, a group of garbage collectors was hit by a
roadside bomb, which killed one and wounded eight others, the
official said.


And in nearby Saydiyah, another mixed district, unidentified
gunmen shot dead five civilians and wounded one more, he added.


Insurgents have carried out a steady stream of attacks in
Baghdad, including high-profile car bombs, despite a massive 10
-week-old security crackdown by Iraqi and US troops in the
capital since February 14.


While US commanders say the number of sectarian death squad
murders has come down by about a third since the plan was
launched, bomb attacks have kept up the overall level of
casualties.
