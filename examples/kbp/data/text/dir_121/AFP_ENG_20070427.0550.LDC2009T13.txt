A Ferrari once driven and raced by "King of Cool" Steve McQueen
is being tipped to fetch more than 1 million dollars later this
year when it goes under the hammer, auction house Christie's said
Friday.


The 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso is to be auctioned at
Christie's International Motor Cars auction in Monterey,
California on August 16, and is estimated to go for between
800,000 to 1.2 million dollars.


"We are thrilled to be offering this seductive car," Christopher
Sanger, Head of Christie's Car Sales in the Americas said in a
statement.


Sanger said the Ferrari had been used regularly by iconic actor
and noted car enthusiast McQueen in daily life.


"This was his personal run around -- not a film one-off extra --
but a car used for the grocery run, as well as trips to the
racetrack."


McQueen, the star of classic films such as "The Great Escape",
"Papillon" and "Bullitt" built a large collection of cars as his
wealth and fame grew.


The Berlinetta Lusso was the first Ferrari to be parked in his
garage, Christie's said.


McQueen, who died in 1980 aged 50, traded the car in 1973 before
it ended up in the hands of a restorer.
