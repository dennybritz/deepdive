Thailand's army-backed Premier Surayud Chulanont shored up his
cabinet Saturday amid growing criticism of his handling of the
economy and unrest in the country's Muslim south.


It was the fourth cabinet change since Surayud, a former general,
took office after a September coup, and came a day after some
4,000 Thais rallied in Bangkok against his government.


Friday's protest was organized by allies of ousted prime minister
Thaksin Shinawatra, who has remained in self-exile abroad since
the coup.


Surayud added three deputy ministers to his cabinet after
Thailand's widely respected King Bhumibol Adulyadej approved them
on Friday, said government spokesman Yongyuth Mayalarp.


The three new deputies will work for the tourism, health and
interior ministries, the spokesman said.


The Surayud cabinet has suffered falling public support with
Thais becoming increasingly disillusioned with a series of policy
miscues, including poor economic management.


Hit by post-coup political worries and depressed consumer
confidence, Thailand's economy is seen rising just 3.8-4.8
percent in 2007, the lowest growth in six years.


Apart from the slowing economy, the Surayud government has come
under heavy criticism over an escalating insurgency in the
Muslim-majority south, where more than 2,100 people have been
killed in the three-year unrest.


After the September power-grab, the junta had promised to hold
elections within a year, but then dithered about setting a
precise date.


But Surayud announced last month that polls will be held in
December.
