Some 18 Chinese fishermen were reported missing after being
attacked when their boat broke down in the South China Sea, state
media said Saturday.


The fishermen from the southern island of Hainan had twice
succeeded in contacting relatives to alert them, the Xinhua news
agency said.


The captain first called his wife at dawn on Thursday and asked
her to inform the police that pirates were aboard robbing the
boat.


He then called a cousin 20 minutes later and said the first
robbers had left with his catch of fish but a second suspect boat
had approached, Xinhua said, citing local police.


There had been further contact with the captain and police were
searching for the missing fishermen, it said.
