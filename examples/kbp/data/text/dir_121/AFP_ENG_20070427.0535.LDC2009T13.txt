Ugandan soldiers have killed at least 38 members of Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group in gun battles near the
border with the Democratic Republic of Congo over the past month,
an army spokesman said on Friday.


In addition, seven rebels surrendered and five were captured in
clashes since March 28, said army officials Lieutenant Kiconco.


"Two of our soldiers died in one of the battles while one died
from wounds while undergoing treatment at a hospital," he told
AFP from his base in western Uganda.


The ADF, a mix of Islamist and secular guerrillas, has been
fighting the government since 1996, and was blamed for bombings
and massacres in the late 1990s.


Last month, the army said it had killed at least 38 rebels as it
steps up attacks on ADF, a dormant outfit that believed to be
regrouping in the votalite eastern DRC.
