Turks will oppose efforts to erode their country's stability,
Islamist-rooted Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said
Saturday, after the army warned his government was not doing
enough to defend the secular system.


"The political unity and social structure... of this country can
sometimes be subject to disasters," he told a gathering of the
Turkish Red Crescent here.


"This nation has paid a heavy, painful price when the base of
stability and confidence has been lost. But it no longer allows,
nor will it allow, opportunists who are waiting and paving the
way for a disaster."


In an unusually strongly worded statement late Friday, the
Turkish army said it was concerned by the presidential election
in which Erdogan's pick, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, is the
sole candidate.


The general staff said it was preoccupied with rising Islamist
influence in Turkey and said it would act to defend the
separation of state and religion.


"Neither the nation, nor history will forgive those who attempt
to hurt or overshadow our social structure or spirit of
solidarity and benevolence," Erdogan said.
