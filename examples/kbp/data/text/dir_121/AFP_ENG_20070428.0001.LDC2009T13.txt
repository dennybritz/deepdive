Six men were killed when a truck carrying illegally logged wood
in central Vietnam crashed, state media said Saturday.


The accident happened early Friday when a truck drove off the
road into a rice field in Kon Tum province, in the central
highlands, said the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper.


Six out of the seven people sitting on the truck were killed
after they were buried beneath the heavy wooden logs. The male
victims, aged between 17 and 30 years old, were mostly from the
Ba Na ethnic minority group.


The truck driver and his assistant suffered minor injuries, Tuoi
Tre said. No other vehicles were involved.


In central Ninh Thuan province the same day, at least 20 people
were injured, some of them seriously, after a multi-vehicle
accident.


Last year, more than 12,300 people were killed in traffic
accidents in Vietnam, according to the National Traffic Safety
Committee.
