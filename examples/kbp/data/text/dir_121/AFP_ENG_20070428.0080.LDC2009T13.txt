A man killed in rioting sparked by the removal of a Soviet-era
monument in the Estonian capital this week was a Russian
national, the Russian foreign ministry said Saturday.


"At first the Estonian authorities answered official enquiries by
insisting that none of our citizens were among the injured. It
later became clear that a Russian citizen had died," the foreign
ministry said in a statement.


The Estonian prosecutor's office confirmed to AFP that a man
named as Dmitri, who was stabbed to death overnight Thursday in
riots over the removal of a Soviet war memorial, was a Russian
citizen.


"Dmitri is a citizen of the Russian Federation," Gerrit Maesalu,
spokesman for the Estonian prosecutor's office, told AFP.


"He died in a stabbing incident, and a criminal investigation
regarding his death is under way. No suspect has been apprehended
yet," he said.


Earlier, the Estonian authorities had said there was "no reason
to link the death of Dmitri to police activity."


The Russian foreign ministry statement accused Estonian law
enforcement of using "excessive force used against demonstrators
defending a memorial to those who fought against fascism."


About 900 people, including many drunken teenagers, have been
detained in two nights of rioting in Estonia.


The unrest is the worst to rock Tallinn since Estonia regained
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, officials said.


The Bronze Soldier Soviet war memorial is seen by Estonians as a
symbol of 50 years of Soviet occupation following World War II.


Russia considers it a sacred memorial to the Red Army soldiers
who defeated Nazism, and has threatened Tallinn with diplomatic
and economic retaliation.
