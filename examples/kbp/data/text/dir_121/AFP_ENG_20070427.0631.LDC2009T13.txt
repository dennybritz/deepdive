Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Friday on the
restructuring of the country's nuclear energy industry that is to
lead to the creation of a new state holding company,
Atomenergoprom.


The restructuring was necessary to ensure "the conservation and
development of the scientific potential and the production" of
Russia's nuclear industry, the presidential press service said in
a statement.


The new company, 100 percent state-owned, should enable Russia
"to consolidate its competitiveness on the international markets
in the field of civil nuclear energy," the statement added.


Putin had talked about his vision for the industry during a
speech to the nation on Thursday.


"A special company should be created to establish a link between
nuclear energy and industrial companies and should be active on
the national and international market," he said.


He also said that 26 new nuclear power stations would be built in
the next 12 years, nearly as many as during the Soviet period
when 30 were built.


According to Russian news agency Ria Novosti, citing an unnamed
source, the restructuring is to take place in stages with the new
holding company to be created on January 1, 2008.
