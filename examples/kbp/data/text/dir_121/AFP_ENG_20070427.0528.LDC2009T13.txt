The United States welcomed Friday Saudi Arabia's arrest of 172
suspected Al- Qaeda militants, saying it shows Riyadh's
commitment to the US war on terror.


"We welcome the arrests by the Saudis today," said State
Department spokesman Tom Casey.


"I think this shows that the Saudis are continuing their efforts
to be a good partner with us in the war on terror," Casey told
reporters.


"It's important that they and other countries continue to do
everything they can not only to try and deal with those who are
responsible for acts of violence, but to break up those cells and
break up those individuals who are intending to commit acts of
violence or who in any other way -- whether through financial
means or otherwise -- are supporting terror networks."


Earlier Friday Saudi Arabia announced it had seized arms and
money and rounded up 172 militants which it said were plotting
airborne attacks on oil facilities and army bases.
