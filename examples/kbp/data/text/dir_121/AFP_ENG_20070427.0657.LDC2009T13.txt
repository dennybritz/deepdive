Chinese president Hu Jintao Saturday called for closer economic
and cultural relations with Taiwan to curb the island's
secessionist activities and maintain peace, Xinhua news agency
said.


Hu made the remarks to participants attending the third cross-
Taiwan Strait economic, trade and cultural forum at the Great
Hall of the People, in Beijing.


The mainland's robust economic growth offered more opportunities,
stronger impetus and better conditions for cross-strait economic
exchanges and cooperation, Hu said.


He met in Beijing with Kuomintang (KMT, Taiwan's main opposition
party) honorary chairman Lien Chan, a former vice president of
Taiwan, according to the official agency.


About 500 participants from the mainland and Taiwan were
attending the two-day forum, which opened in Beijing Saturday
morning.


Participants were set to discuss issues including direct flights
across the Taiwan Strait, cooperation in education and mainland
citizens' travel to Taiwan, Xinhua said.


A report from Taipei's government-funded Central News Agency said
the forum was jointly sponsored by the KMT.
