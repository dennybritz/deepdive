Five members of a criminal gang were killed in an early morning
shoot-out with Philippine police Saturday, radio reports said.


The men had stolen a cargo truck and were chased by police before
being cornered in a suburban area north of the capital Manila,
the reports said, quoting police.


The firefight left all five of the gang members dead. There were
no reported police casualties.


Police said the gang had been under surveillance over the past
few weeks for a string of heists.


Early this month, five suspected robbers wearing police jackets
were killed in a similar clash with Manila police.
