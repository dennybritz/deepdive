The Croatian parliament ratified on Friday the Kyoto Protocol on
cutting greenhouse gases aimed at slowing global warning which
affects Earth's climate.


Croatia has signed the protocol back in 1999 but it did not
ratify it until getting a green light for a higher limit of
annual carbon dioxide emissions which was granted last year.


Under its Kyoto Protocol commitments Croatia should not emit more
than 34.62 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.


To fulfill its commitments the Balkan country is planning to make
several steps such as building of wind farms and facilities using
biomass, increasing the use of biofuel and solar energy.


The Kyoto Protocol commits industrialised countries that have
signed and ratified it to make cuts amounting to around five
percent in their emissions.


The United States has refused to ratify it. Under its present
format, fast- growing developing countries such as China and
India, which have recently become big polluters, do not have to
make binding cuts.
