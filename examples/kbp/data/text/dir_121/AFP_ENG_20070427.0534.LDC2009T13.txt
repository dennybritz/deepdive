Police arrested the former head of the Burundian president's
political party on Friday for allegedly organising ex-rebels, the
attorney general said.


Hussein Radjabu, who has been at odds with President Pierre
Nkurunziza, was accused of "harming the internal security of the
state," said attorney general Jean-Bosco Ndikumana.


Radjabu proclaimed his innocence to an AFP journalist.


According to the attorney general, Radjabu was attempting to
organise former rebels to possibly "disrupt public order." He was
taken to prison under heavy security.


Parliament members recently lifted Radjabu's immunity.


The party Radjabu formerly led came to power following 2005
elections. He was replaced as leader of the National Council for
the Defence of Democracy-Front for the Defence of Democracy
(CNDD-FDD) in February.


Tensions had been rising in Burundi at the time, when a crisis
within the CNDD- FDD threatened to set off clashes in the small
central African nation, which has struggled to emerge from 13
years of civil war.


Radjabu was criticized for his arrogance and his strong-fisted
leadership, and diplomatic sources in Bujumbura said Nkurunziza
sought the removal of Radjabu because he "was casting a shadow
over him."


Earlier this month, Nkurunziza called on authorities to arrest
"the people who want to sow discord" in the country.
