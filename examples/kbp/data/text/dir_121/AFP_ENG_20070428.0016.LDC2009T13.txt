Sri Lankan police and security forces sealed off the capital on
Saturday, searching every vehicle entering and leaving the city
amid fears of a Tamil Tiger attack, officials said.


Huge traffic jams were reported at every entry point to Colombo
with motorists spending several hours before they could be
allowed in. Doctors and others essential services were also stuck
at roadblocks.


"This is part of the operations to prevent Tigers getting into
the city," a police official said, adding that the operation
would last about three hours.


The latest measures follow heightened security in the capital
after Thursday's defence ministry reports that Tamil Tiger
guerrillas had entered the air space of the island's only
international airport.


Overnight Thursday, the sky over the Katunayake international
airport near Colombo -- where government warplanes are also
stationed, sharing a runway with civilian passenger jets -- was
lit up with anti-aircraft gunfire.


Authorities also switched off electricity to the capital so that
potential targets would not be illuminated.


The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have been
fighting the government for 35 years and run a mini-state in the
north of the island, bombed the Katunayake air base a month ago
in their first ever air strike.


The separatist rebels also carried out a second air raid on the
Palaly military complex in the island's north on Tuesday.
