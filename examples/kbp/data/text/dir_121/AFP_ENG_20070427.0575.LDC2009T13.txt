Frederik Michalak, playing in his first full game for six months,
helped Toulouse to a 41-10 rout of Narbonne in the French Top 14
here on Friday.


Michalak, who next season will play for South African side Natal
Sharks, made his comeback from a long injury lay-off last week
but played only 10 minutes against Castres.


Toulouse were out to cement their place in the league's top four
and they achieved their goal in style with Michalak playing a
major role in setting up Cedric Heymans for the first of his four
tries.


Jean-Baptiste Elissalde contributed 19 points to Toulouse's tally
with the help of his reliable boot.


Toulouse moved up a place to second behind Stade Francais who
take on Montauban on Saturday.
