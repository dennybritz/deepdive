Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, who on Friday signed a new year-one
deal with the Gunners, admits he was tempted by a move back home
to Germany.


Speaking publically for the first time since ending speculation
over his future Lehmann, 37, says last year's stint in Germany
for the World Cup did whet his appetite for a return to the
Bundesliga but he found it impossible to call time on his Gunners
career.


The Germany goalkeeper told Arsenal TV Online on Saturday: "I am
staying for another year and I'm delighted about that.


"I said I always loved it here but, of course, I had to make a
decision.


"I could have gone somewhere else but in the end I think there is
a good possibility to harvest something at this club,
particularly next season. I want to be a part of that.


"For a while I considered going back to Germany because we
(Lehmann and his family) loved it there during the last World
Cup. My wife and children are very happy here but they could have
imagined going back to Germany and that is why we considered
leaving.


"But at the end as I said before the quality of the football
here, the club, the stadium and the fans - I know that and I like
that. It is the perfect environment for me to play football. I
don't know if I would have found that somewhere else."
