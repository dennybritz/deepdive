Police shot dead one person and injured a dozen others in a clash
on Saturday with an ethnic group trying to impose a road blockade
southeast of the Nepalese capital, police said.


It was the latest bloodshed in an ongoing battle by a variety of
ethnic groups demanding greater regional autonomy and a bigger
voice in national politics.


"One person was killed in police firing and 12 others were
injured," said Chandra Timilsina, a police officer from Sarlahi
district, 80 kilometres (50 miles) southeast of Kathmandu.


Eight policemen suffered minor injuries when they were pelted
with stones by the protesters, he added.


The violence erupted when ethnic activists from the Chure Bhawar
Unity Society attacked police who were trying to break up a
general strike imposed by the group, police said.


On Monday, the group called the indefinite strike in the southern
Terai region, a pressure tactic aimed at paralysing the key
economic area known as Nepal's breadbasket.


Initially the protest was not widely observed but on Friday the
strike paralysed traffic along a main east-west highway,
stranding thousands of cars.


Nepal's government and former Maoist rebels struck a peace deal
late last year ending a decade of bloody civil war.


But the unrest by ethnic groups who are seeking regional autonomy
and a federal system of government has marred the landmark
accord.


Since January, at least 62 people have been killed in the ethnic
unrest in the Terai region, home to nearly 50 percent of Nepal's
27 million population.
