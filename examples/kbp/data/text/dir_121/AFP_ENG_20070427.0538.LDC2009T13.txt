Lawmakers in Poland's lower house on Friday elected Ludwik Dorn
as the new parliamentary speaker.


Dorn, a former interior minister and deputy prime minister under
Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, replaces Marek Jurek, who
stood down in protest at parliament's failure to toughen up
Poland's already strict anti-abortion laws.


Dorn is known for his strong anti-communist leanings and his
close ties to the prime minister and his identical twin,
President Lech Kaczynski.


He helped the Kaczynskis found the conservative Law and Justice
(PiS) party, which did best in elections in 2005 and now rules
Poland in coalition with the far right and populists.


He is a keen fan of John Le Carre spy novels, and has translated
many into Polish.
