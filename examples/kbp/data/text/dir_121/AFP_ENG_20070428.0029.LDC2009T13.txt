A French woman -- one of five hostages held by the Taliban in
Afghanistan for three weeks -- has been released in the southern
province of Kandahar, a Taliban spokesman told AFP.


"Today at 11:05 (0635 GMT) the French female hostage was released
in Maiwand district of Kandahar province," Taliban spokesman
Yousuf Ahmadi said.


The Taliban would give the French government another week to
negotiate the release of a French man and three Afghans who were
captured with her, another Taliban spokesman said earlier.
