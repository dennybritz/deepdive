Malaysians went to the polls Saturday in a tiny, but crucial
state by-election seen as a test for the political future of
sacked former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.


Although not contesting, Anwar has put his weight behind the
opposition candidate in a bitter and gruelling campaign against
the powerful ruling national front, or Barisan Nasional (BN) led
by prime minster Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.


The weekend poll is seen as a litmus test of popularity for both
sides ahead of a general election expected before 2009.


Polls opened amid tight security and slight rain as voters lined
up at nine polling stations in the tiny semi-rural constituency
of Ijok, in central Selangor state.


Voting started at 8.00am (0000GMT) and was set to close at 5.00pm
Saturday.


Marking a forceful return to politics, Anwar has mounted a
campaign for the opposition People's Justice Party or Keadilan
against BN. The BN has dominated Malaysian politics since
independence in 1957.


The campaign period has also been marred by scuffles from
supporters.


Fatimah Sulaiman, 84, sitting in a wheelchair, cast her vote and
proudly said: "I've voted three times previously. I am happy to
cast my vote."


Fatimah voted at the Bukit Gadong National school in a Malay-
majority area, which is used as one of the polling stations.
