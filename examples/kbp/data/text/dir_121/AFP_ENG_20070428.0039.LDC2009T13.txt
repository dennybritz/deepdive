A French woman -- one of five hostages held by the Taliban in
Afghanistan for three weeks -- has been released in the southern
province of Kandahar, a Taliban spokesman told AFP.


"Today at 11:05 (0635 GMT) the French female hostage was released
in Maiwand district of Kandahar province," Taliban spokesman
Yousuf Ahmadi said.


Afghan officials could not immediately confirm the release. The
French embassy in Kabul said: "We are awaiting confirmation."


The Taliban will give the French government another week to
negotiate the release of a French man and three Afghans who were
captured with her, Ahmadi said.


"We have extended the deadline for the French man and three
Afghan hostages for another week," he said.


The woman, who has been named in the media only as Celine, was
carrying a message to the French government that it must "cut its
military assistance to Afghanistan," Ahmadi said.


"She was released to show our good intentions towards the French
government," he added.


Another spokesman for the movement, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the
extension was granted to the French government "since they have
elections and they are busy."


"We will give the French woman a letter containing our demands
from the French government," he said.
