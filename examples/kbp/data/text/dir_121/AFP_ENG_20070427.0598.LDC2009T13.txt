Ecuador underscored Friday its intention to reduce to a minimum
its ties to the World Bank after kicking out its envoy whom Quito
accused of extortion.


Economy Minister Ricardo Patino told Teleamazonas television that
"we have been reducing our credit relationship with the bank and
we want to reduce it to a minimum."


President Rafael Correa gave Brazilian Eduardo Somensatto 72
hours to leave the country and declared him persona non grata for
allegedly not disbursing a 100 million dollar loan that had been
approved to punish Ecuador for oil sector reform when Correa was
serving as economy minister in 2005.


"With the IMF, no relationship, and the World Bank the bare
minimum," Patino added.


Correa said the bank froze the credit to punish him for reforming
the oil industry, and accused the multilateral lender of
"extortion."


Correa's reform was designed to create an oil fund to buy back
Ecuador's sovereign foreign debt.
