European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana called on
Friday for the United States to open a "channel of communication"
with Iran on all subjects.


"I think that at this point in time to have also the USA open a
channel of communication with Iran would be worth thinking about
... on everything," Solana said after talks with Iran's nuclear
negotiator Ali Larijani this week.
