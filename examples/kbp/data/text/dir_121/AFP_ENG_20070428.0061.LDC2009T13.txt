A rare moderate earthquake hit southern England on Saturday,
toppling chimneys and alarming residents, authorities said.


The local emergency services said they had received "lots and
lots" of calls from local people reporting that "their chimneys
have fallen down (and) large cracks in people's houses."


Hendrick van Eck, 27, from Canterbury, said that the tremor,
which hit at around 8:15am (0715 GMT), lasted just a few seconds.


"I then heard the sound of cracking and it was getting heavier
and heavier. It felt as if someone was at the end of my bed
hopping up and down," he said.


The BBC reported that electricity was off in the area following
the quake.


According to the US Geological Survey, which monitors earth
tremors the quake measured  4.7 on the open-ended Moment
Magnitude scale, now used by US seismologists.


The epicenter of the tremor, which it said occurred at 8:18 am
local time (0718 GMT), was located 25 kilometers (15 miles) south
of the city of Canterbury.


The depth of the epicenter was put at 7.1 kilometers (4.4 miles).
