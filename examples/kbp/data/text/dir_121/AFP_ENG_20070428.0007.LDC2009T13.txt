The plane carrying Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski on a
working visit to Qatar and Kuwait was barred from flying over
Iraq "for security reasons" and turned back, officials said here
Saturday.


"The plane was turned around for security reasons. A new date for
the visit will be settled through diplomatic channels,"
government spokesman Jan Dziedziczak was quoted as saying by the
PAP news agency.


An official in Kaczynski's cabinet, Andrzej Sados, said: "The
(air traffic) control services for one of Iraq's internal zones
did not give its go-ahead for the crossing. The plane had to turn
back and landed in Ankara."


After a six-hour wait the premier decided to put off his visit
and the aircraft returned to Warsaw.


Kaczynski, accompanied by his defence and economy ministers, had
hoped to discuss cooperation in the energy and naval production
sectors while in Qatar and Kuwait.
