German prosecutors said Friday they did not plan to launch
proceedings against former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld
over claims of torture of prisoners in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.


Prosecutors in the southern city of Karlsruhe said that the
alleged wrongdoings took place outside Germany and that those
accused were neither German nor lived in the country.


In November The Center for Constitutional Rights, a group of
international lawyers, filed the suit in Germany.


It was directed against Rumsfeld as well as former CIA head
George Tenet, US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and nine other
top legal and military officials in the United States.
