More than 1,100 youngsters in Vietnam were arrested early
Saturday morning following a raid on the biggest disco in Hanoi,
state media said.


Hanoi's notorious New Century club was surrounded by hundreds of
police, said the online VNExpress newspaper.


Initial tests showed that at least 500 people had taken drugs.
Police found various substances in the club, including heroin and
ecstasy pills, it said.


VNExpress said Hanoi police were not aware of the raid, which had
been carried out secretly by national police.


National police forces involved in the raid refused to comment.


Ecstasy and most synthetic drugs available in Vietnam are thought
to come from Cambodia, Hong Kong or the Golden Triangle region,
stretching across parts of Laos, Thailand and Myanmar.
