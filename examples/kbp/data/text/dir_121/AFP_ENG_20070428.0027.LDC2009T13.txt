A French woman among five hostages held by the Taliban in
Afghanistan for three weeks will be released at 11:30 am (0700
GMT) Saturday on humanitarian grounds, a Taliban spokesman told
AFP.


"At 11:30 the female French hostage will be released," a Taliban
spokesman for eastern and southeastern Afghanistan, Zabihullah
Mujahed, said. She would be freed in the southern city of
Kandahar, he said.


The Taliban would give the French government another week to
negotiate the release of a French man and three Afghans who were
captured with her, he said.
