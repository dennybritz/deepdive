As gusty winds blew newly installed world No. 1 and defending
champion Lorena Ochoa off course on Friday, LPGA rookie Angela
Park made her move at the Corona Championship.


Park, a Brazilian citizen of Korean heritage who spent part of
her childhood in California, fired a career-best 8-under-par 65
to move into a three-way tie for first place in the second round
of the 1.3 million-dollar tournament.


She shared the lead with Italy's Silvia Cavalleri (68) and
Taiwan's Yu Ping Lin (65) at 9-under 137.


Ochoa, hoping to reward her adoring home fans with a victory this
week - which would also celebrate her ascent to the world No. 1
spot long held by Annika Sorenstam - carded a 1-over 74 at the
windy Tres Marias course and fell into a tie for 16th.


The reigning Player of Year had started the day one shot off the
lead.


British-born South Korean Sarah Lee was a shot off the lead after
matching an LPGA Tour record for nine holes with a 6-under 28 on
the front nine - her final nine.


Posting an eagle on the par-5 eighth, she finished with a 66.


Making just her seventh career start, Park finished with a
flourish, with birdies on her final five holes and six of her
last seven.


She ended up with nine birdies against just one bogey.


Lin, who missed the cut in her three previous starts, carded
seven birdies during a bogey-free round.
