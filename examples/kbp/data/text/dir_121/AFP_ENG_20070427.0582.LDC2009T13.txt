The staunchly secularist Turkish army issued a harsh warning
Friday against questioning the country's secular system and said
it would "openly display its position and attitudes when it
becomes necessary."


"The problem that has recently stood out in the presidential
election process has focused on the issue of questioning
secularism. The Turkish armed forces are following this with
concern," the general staff said in a statement late in the
evening.


It was posted on the army web site hours after parliament held a
first round of voting in the presidential election, in which
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul of the ruling Islamist-rooted
Justice and Development Party (AKP) was the sole candidate.


"It should not be forgotten that the Turkish armed forces are a
side in this debate and are a staunch defender of secularism.


"The Turkish armed forces are against those debates... and will
display their position and attitudes when it becomes necessary.
No one should doubt that," the statement said.


The main opposition secularist Republican People's Party, which
insists that the presidency cannot be left to the AKP, petitioned
the Constitutional Court to annul the vote on the grounds of a
technicality.


The AKP is the moderate offshoot of the Welfare Party of Turkey's
first Islamist prime minister Necmettin Erbakan, which was forced
from power as a result of a harsh army-led secularist campaign in
1997 and was outlawed the following year.


The army has carried out three coups, in 1960, 1971 and 1980.
