The staunchly secularist Turkish army said Friday it was
following with "concern" the debate over the country's secular
system in the presidential elections and would "openly display
its position and attitudes when it becomes necessary."


"It should not be forgotten that the Turkish armed forces are a
side in this debate and are a staunch defender of secularism,"
the general staff said in a statement on its web site.


It was posted hours after parliament held a first round of voting
in the presidential election.


"The Turkish armed forces are against those debates... and will
display its position and attitudes when it becomes necessary. No
one should doubt that," it said.
