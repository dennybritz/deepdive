The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexis II, has been
hospitalized in Switzerland due to health problems, an official
at the church's Moscow headquarters said on Friday.


"The Patriarch Alexis II has some health problems. He has been in
a hospital in Switzerland for several days," the official told
AFP on condition of anonymity.


The Echo of Moscow radio station quoted a source in Switzerland
as saying the 78 -year-old patriarch's condition was "rather
serious."


The official spokesman for the Moscow patriarchate, Vsevolod
Chaplin, declined to reveal the patriarch's whereabouts but told
AFP he would be returning to Moscow in the coming days.


Alexis II has a history of heart problems.


He was notably absent from Wednesday's state funeral of Russian
president Boris Yeltsin, with whom he had close relations.


The Russian Orthodox Church is the largest of the Eastern
Orthodox Churches and has seen a resurgence since the end of
secular Soviet rule.
