Undefeated Juan Diaz defends his World Boxing Association
lightweight crown on Saturday against Brazilian veteran Acelino
Freitas.


Diaz, a 23-year-old who boasts a record of 31-0 with 15 wins
inside the distance, will be making his sixth defence of the
title he won from Lakva Sim in July 2004.


He won a unanimous decision from Fernando Angulo in November in
his last bout.


But in Freitas, who holds the lightly regarded World Boxing
Organization belt, he will be meeting a much more experienced
fighter.


Freitas (38-1, 32 knockouts) will be looking for his fourth
straight win after losing his title in embarrassing fashion to
Diego Corrales in August 2004.


Freitas quit in the middle of the 10th round of that lopsided
encounter.


Even though he has not lost since the beating he took against
Corrales, Freitas has been unimpressive.


Freitas, 31, recaptured the vacant WBO title by winning a split
decision from timid Zahir Raheem on April 29, 2006, but late last
year was flirting with retirement.


Diaz, meanwhile, could take a major step in his career with a
victory.


"This is a great opportunity for me," said Diaz, who is nicknamed
"Baby Bull" for his relentless style and aggression. "Freitas is
obviously a great fight for me. It's what I've been waiting for
my whole career."
