Indonesia's Forestry Minister said he could not accept the
release of illegal logging suspects and called for an
investigation of judges handling the cases, reports said
Saturday.


District courts in North and West Sumatra provinces recently
released suspects in illegal logging cases, deciding prosecution
charges were groundless, The Jakarta Post daily reported.


But minister Malam Sambat Kaban insisted that police and
prosecutors would not have brought charges unless there had been
strong evidence.


"Judges who release illegal logging suspects should be
investigated by the Supreme Court," he said, adding that
releasing the suspects would encourage illegal logging.


"The verdict has justified what the suspects have been doing all
the time," Kaban reportedly said.


He said 37.6 million hectares (93 million acres) of forest were
in critical condition. The government has launched a
reforestation programme this year, aiming to replant two million
hectares of forest.
