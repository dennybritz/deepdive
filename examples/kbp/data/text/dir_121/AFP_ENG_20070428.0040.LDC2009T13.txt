Three men were shot dead in Thailand's restive Muslim-majority
south Saturday as the kingdom marked the third anniversary of a
mosque massacre, police said.


A 45-year-old Muslim man was killed in a drive-by shooting and
another 37-year- old Muslim man was gunned down by suspected
Islamic rebels in an ambush in Narathiwat, one of three troubled
provinces bordering Malaysia.


In nearby Pattani province, a 70-year-old Buddhist man was shot
dead late Friday in a drive-by shooting while riding a
motorcycle.


The attacks came as Thailand marked the third anniversary of the
Krue Se Mosque massacre in 32 suspected militants were killed by
Thai security forces in Pattani.


Earlier in the day, a man opened fire on the Krue Se mosque where
some 20 Muslims gathered for morning prayers. But no one was
injured, police said.


More than 2,100 people have been killed in three years of unrest
in the southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani.


The military-backed government, which came to power after a
September coup, has made peace-building efforts in a bid to rein
in the insurgency, but violence has escalated in the last six
months.


The three troubled provinces were once an autonomous sultanate,
until the Muslim-majority region was annexed by mainly Buddhist
Thailand a century ago. Separatist unrest has erupted
periodically ever since.
