Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi held at the US base at Guantanamo Bay
for nearly five years, said Sunday his "nightmare is finally at
an end" in a statement issued after he returned to Britain, where
he lives.


He also spoke of the "hopelessness" and "extreme isolation"
suffered by detainees and asked to be granted time with his
family to come to terms with his "horrific experience".
