Retired swimming star Ian Thorpe on Sunday protested his
innocence and said he was confident he would be cleared of doping
allegations against him.


"I have never cheated and I pride myself on my record,"
Australia's most decorated Olympian told a press conference.


"My reputation has already been tarnished and it is the hardest
thing to take.


"I was physically shaking in my room when I heard the news, it is
gut wrenching, it really is.


"I believe there will be an innocent explanation for it all. My
doctor is preparing a list of all the medicines I might have
taken at that time."


Thorpe was forced back into the spotlight on Saturday following
revelations that swimming governing body, FINA, was aiming to
reopen a case surrounding high levels of naturally-occurring
hormones in one of his doping tests.
