Sri Lankan war planes bombed a suspected Tamil Tiger naval base
in the island's northeast as violence continued in the bitter
ethnic conflict, the military said Sunday.


Supersonic jets hit a "Sea Tiger" base in the Mullaitivu region
and Tiger rebels set off two separate roadside bombs that killed
a police commando and wounded five others Saturday, the military
said.


They said the guerrillas and troops exchanged fire across the
northern and eastern regions at the weekend.


There was no immediate reaction from the Tigers to Saturday's air
strikes but in a statement Sunday they claimed that the air force
had dropped bombs near a school earlier in the week.


The rebels have waged a 35-year campaign for independence that
has claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
