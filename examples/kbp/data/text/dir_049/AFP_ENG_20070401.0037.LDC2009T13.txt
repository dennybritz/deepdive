The Israeli army overnight sealed off the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip for the duration of the Jewish week-long Passover
holiday, a military spokeswoman said on Sunday.


"The closure will be maintained for security reasons during the
eight days of the holiday," she said.


Passover, during which Jews celebrate their Biblical escape from
Egypt, begins at sunset on Monday and finishes at sunset on April
9.


During the closure, doctors, journalists, lawyers, staff of non-
governmental organisations and those in need of humanitarian aid
will be allowed to travel to the Palestinian territories, the
army said in a statement.


"The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) regards the holiday period as a
highly sensitive time, security wise," it said.


"Accordingly, the IDF will increase its alertness in order to
ensure the safety of the citizens of Israel, while preserving, to
the best of its ability, the daily life of the Palestinian
population."
