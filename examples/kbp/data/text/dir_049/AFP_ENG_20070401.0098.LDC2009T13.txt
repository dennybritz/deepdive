Japanese mobile phone giant NTT DoCoMo said Sunday it resumed a
service allowing customers to change carriers while keeping their
phone numbers, after massive transactions paralysed its
computers.


Japan's largest mobile company was forced to halt the service
Saturday night for about 80 minutes after a flood of applications
for sign-ups and cancellations paralysed its computer system, it
said in a statement.


The launch last year of the number-portability system -- which
lets users switch carriers but keep their phone numbers --
sparked fierce competition among three major mobile phone
carriers in Japan, NTT DoCoMo, KDDI Corp. and Softbank Mobile
Corp. to win and keep customers.


"We've been temporarily suspending procedures related to number
portability, but Sunday's operation came back to normal as we
repaired our system," DoCoMo said.


Softbank Mobile experienced similar problems last October
immediately after the number portability system was introduced.


DoCoMo said in January its net profit in the nine months to
December fell nearly 22 percent due partly to fierce competition.


DoCoMo President Masao Nakamura has admitted its rival KDDI "was
the only winner" with the introduction of the number-portability
system.
