A South Korean man set himself on fire Sunday outside a Seoul
hotel where US and South Korean officials were holding talks
inside on a free trade agreement, witnesses said.


"It was so quick. A man was suddenly in flames and a group of
riot police sprayed fire extinguisher on his body," a
photographer at the scene told AFP.


"An ambulance took him immediately to a nearby hospital."


It was unknown why the unidentified man tried to set himself on
fire, but demonstrators were protesting in nearby streets at the
time against free trade agreements.


The hotel where the talks are being held is heavily guarded by
riot police in case protests outside turn violent.


Police were not immediately available for comment.
