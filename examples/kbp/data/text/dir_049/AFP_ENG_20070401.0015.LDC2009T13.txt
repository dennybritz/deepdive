Nepal will hold crucial elections in June as part of a peace deal
that has seen the country's former Maoist rebels granted five
posts in a new interim cabinet, an official said Sunday.


"The leaders of the eight parties (seven mainstream parties and
the Maoists) have also agreed to hold constituent assembly
elections on June 20," said Bhim Rawal, a leader off the
Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).


The polls are being organised to elect a constituent assembly --
a body that will rewrite Nepal's constitution and also decide the
future role of the monarchy in the Himalayan country.


"We have also agreed to get rid of the monarchy if we find proof
that the king is trying to disrupt the constituent assembly
elections," Rawal said.
