A lawmaker from Iraq's leading Sunni Arab political party escaped
unscathed from a roadside bomb attack on Sunday that wounded two
of his bodyguards, security officials said.


Omar Abdul Sattar from the Iraqi Islamic Party -- a key player in
the Shiite and Kurdish dominated parliament -- was travelling in
a convoy when the bomb exploded near the vehicles and party
office in Baghdad, the officials said.


"He escaped unhurt but two of his bodyguards were wounded," said
one official, adding that the attack happened in the capital's
Yarmuk district.


Sattar is the second Sunni Arab leader to be the target of an
assasination attempt in less than 10 days.


The top Sunni official in the government, Deputy Prime Minister
Salam al-Zubayi, was wounded on March 24 in a double bomb attack
near his residence in Baghdad. He had to undergo surgery in a US
combat hospital and is now recuperating in Jordan.


Iraqi and US officials maintain that most attacks against Sunni
leaders are carried out by Al-Qaeda in a bid to stop members of
the former elite community from participating in the country's
political process.
