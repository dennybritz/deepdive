Spanish actor and model Juan Garcia Postigo has won the Mister
World 2007 contest in China, outclassing 55 other competitors to
become the globe's "most desirable man".


Lucas Gil from Brazil and Jiang Lejun from China were named
runners-up at the event televised globally late Saturday from the
city of Sanya on southern China's Hainan island, organisers said
on the event's official website.


The 25-year-old Garcia Postigo has worked as a model and
television actor. He is an avid outdoorsman and traveller who
speaks Italian and English as well as his native Spanish,
according to his biography on the website.


Men from 56 nations competed in the 21-day event that included
tests of style, strength, perseverance, mental agility and
determination.


Competitors strutted their stuff on the catwalk, climbed
mountains, raced bikes and held a cook-off.


The Mister World contest was launched in 1996 in an effort to
choose the "world's most desirable man," the website said.


The previous contest was held in London in 2003, with Gustavo
Cabral Narciso Gianetti from Brazil being crowned the fourth
Mister World.


Sanya, China's southernmost tropical city, hosted the Miss World
pageants from 2003 to 2005.
