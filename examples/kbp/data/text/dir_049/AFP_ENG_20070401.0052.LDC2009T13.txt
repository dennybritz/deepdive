Polls opened in Qatar on Sunday to elect members of the Gulf Arab
state's municipal council, the official Qatari news agency said.


More than 28,000 eligible voters registered to vote in gas-rich
Qatar, which has an indigenous population of 174,000 out of a
total of 750,000 inhabitants.


The municipal elections have failed to stir enthusiasm ahead of
the country's first partial legislative polls, expected later
this year.


In 2003 municipal polls, 38 percent of a registered electorate of
24,125 voted. Some 22,000 voters registered for the first ever
ballot in 1999.
