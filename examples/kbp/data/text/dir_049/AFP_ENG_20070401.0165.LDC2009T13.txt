German Henry Maske ruled out a permanent return to the ring
despite his shock points victory over American Virgil Hill.


The 43-year-old avenged the only defeat of his career, which he
ended 10 years ago after dropping a split points decision to
Hill, also 43.


"As I said before, I came back for just one fight and nothing has
changed," Maske said Sunday on television channel RTS.


The German won a convincing unanimous points decision by scores
of 117-110, 116-113 and 117-110 but Hill's WBA cruiserweight
title was not on the line.


Maske, who came out of retirement to challenge Hill when the
latter won the WBA title, the middleweight version of which he
took from Maske in 1996, by beating Russian Valery Brudov last
year.


Maske earned three million euros for the fight with Hill
pocketing 1.8 million euros.
