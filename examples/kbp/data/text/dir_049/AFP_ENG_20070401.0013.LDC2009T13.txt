Taliban fighters ambushed and killed seven policemen who were on
their way to support another unit under siege in southern
Afghanistan, an official said Sunday.


The ambush took place on Saturday as the reinforcements headed to
a post in Shorabak district in the southwestern corner of the
country where one policeman had been hurt, Kandahar province
police chief Asmatullah Alizay told AFP.


"Seven police were martyred and another three were wounded in the
ambush," the police chief said.


Police returned fire and Alizay said the attackers had suffered
casualties, but was unable to provide figures.


Kandahar, the birthplace in the 1990s of the Taliban, has borne
the brunt of an insurgency launched by the fundamentalist
movement after it was toppled from government in late 2001.


The militants have vowed to topple President Hamid Karzai's
Western-backed government.


More than 130 members of the Afghan security forces have been
killed in attacks this year.
