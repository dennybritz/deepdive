Asia's top budget carrier AirAsia is planning four return flights
a week to Indonesia's Aceh province from June, the airline's
chief said Sunday.


"We have a social obligation to help new economies grow. We want
to help the people in Aceh to get back on their feet," chief
executive Tony Fernandes said.


The flights from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur to the
province's capital Banda Aceh will be AirAsia's 10th destination
in Indonesia.


Fernandes said he was confident the route would be a success as
the carrier was a low cost operator.


Impoverished Aceh bore the brunt of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
that killed more than 130,000 people in the area and destroyed
homes and other buildings.


However before the flights could start, Fernandes said Aceh
authorities would first have to reconstruct the customs,
immigration and quarantine complex at Aceh airport.


AirAsia last month said its net profit for the six months to
December jumped to 227 million ringgit (64.7 million dollars)
from 59.9 million ringgit for the previous six-month period.


AirAsia was launched as a budget carrier in December 2001 with
just two aircraft. It now offers more than 100 domestic and
international flights throughout Southeast Asia.
