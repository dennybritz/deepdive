Flash floods caused by torrential rains killed at least 16 people
and destroyed dozens of houses near the Hindu Kush mountain range
in eastern Afghanistan, police said Sunday.


Floods hit three districts in the northeastern province of
Nuristan overnight and on Sunday, swamping villages and washing
away roads, provincial police chief General Aseel Totakhail told
AFP.


"Sixteen people have died, seven others are wounded, dozens of
houses have been destroyed. Villages have been cut off," he said.


Totakhail asked for urgent help from the government, the United
Nations and foreign forces to evacuate people from the flood-
affected area.


"Many people need to be air-lifted. Hundreds of families left
homeless are in need of immediate help," he said.


Floods also affected the nearby eastern provinces of Kunar,
Laghman and Nangarhar, causing damage to houses and farms but no
human casualties were reported.


Heavy rain has caused flooding across Afghanistan in the past
weeks with avalanches also claiming several lives.


Dozens of mudbrick houses in the capital Kabul were in ruins
Sunday after a downpour Saturday. The Kabul River that runs
through the city, usually as a dirty stream, was overflowing its
banks Sunday.
