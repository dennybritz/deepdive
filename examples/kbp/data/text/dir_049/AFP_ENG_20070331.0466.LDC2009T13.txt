Japanese trading house Itochu Corp. plans to invest some 100
billion yen (850 million dollars) in developing natural gas in
the United States, a report said Sunday.


In 2007, Itochu intends to spend roughly 25 billion yen on gas
development, including concessions in 15 gas fields in the Gulf
of Mexico that it formally obtained on Friday, the Japanese
business daily Nikkei reported.


It did not specify its sources.


The investment through to 2010 comes as the United States is
accelerating efforts to encourage the use of natural gas as an
alternative energy source to reduce its reliance on oil.


Itochu won concessions ranging from 10-49 percent in the 15 gas
fields from Range Resources by acquiring two subsidiaries of the
midsize US gas developer, the report said.


The Japanese company wants to sell the gas to local power
utilities, chemical makers and other firms equipped with their
own power generation facilities through a network of pipelines in
the United States that will be connected to its gas production
facilities, it said.


Officials of Itochu were not immediately available for comment.


In January, US President George W. Bush unveiled plans to slash
gasoline usage, make cars greener and double US emergency reserve
of crude in his annual State of the Union address to Congress.
