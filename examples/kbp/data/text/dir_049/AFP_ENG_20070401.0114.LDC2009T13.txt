A Ugandan soldier was killed by artillery fire in the war-torn
Somali capital Mogadishu, marking the first death among African
Union peacekeepers deployed here, an army spokesman said on
Sunday.


"One of the troops was killed and five others wounded near the
presidential palace on Saturday," Captain Paddy Ankunda, the
spokesman for AU peacekeepers, told AFP.


"It was in the morning when a mortar shell landed near the area
where they were deployed and caused those casualties," he added.


The death came as Ethiopian troops battled with Islamist
insurgents in Mogadishu for the fourth straight day, leaving a
trail of fatalities.


Uganda has deployed at least 1,500 peacekeepers in the Somali
capital. They are an initial contigent of 8,000 peacekeepers the
AU plans to send into Somalia to help the country's feeble
government regain control.


The peacekeepers, who arrived in Mogadishu on March 6, were met
with a barrage of mortar at the airport. They also clashed with
the rebels in a key intersection in southern Somalia.


The Ugandans, who have received death threats, have largely
stayed out of the current conflict that has shaken Mogadishu.


The AU mission is the first international peacekeeping venture
since United States troops led an ill-fated, UN-backed peace
operation in the early 1990s.


Somalia, a nation of about 10 million people, has lacked a
functional government since the 1991 ouster of dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre.
