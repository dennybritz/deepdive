A lawmaker belonging to Ukraine's pro-Western opposition
coalition was injured and two people killed in a car crash in
Kiev, the police reported Sunday.


Andriy Shkil's car ran into another around midnight on Saturday,
police said, adding that two passengers in the other vehicle died
on the spot.


The lawmaker was taken to a hospital with head injuries, his
press secretary was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.


A nationalist opposition leader, Vyatcheslav Chornovil, was
killed in a car crash in March 1999, a few months ahead of the
presidential vote.


Some of his friends believe he was murdered by the authorities,
but police insist the crash was an accident.
