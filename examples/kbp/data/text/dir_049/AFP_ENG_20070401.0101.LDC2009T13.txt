A Ugandan soldier was killed by artillery fire in the war-torn
Somali capital Mogadishu, marking the first death among African
Union peacekeepers deployed here, an army spokesman said on
Sunday.


"One of the troops was killed and five others wounded near the
presidential palace on Saturday," Captain Paddy Ankunda, the
spokesman for AU peacekeepers told AFP.


"It was in the morning when a mortar shell landed near the area
where they were deployed and caused those casualties" he added.
