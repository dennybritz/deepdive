A four-old-girl girl has become the 32nd case of bird flu
reported in Egypt, the fifth child afflicted in the North African
country during the past week.


The health ministry said late on Saturday that Mariam Abdel Fatah
from the town of Qanater, just north of Cairo, had been diagnosed
with the H5N1 virus and taken to a hospital specialising in
treating the condition.


Two other cases, both children from the impoverished south of
Egypt, were announced the same day: Ibrahim Mahmud Helmi, four,
from Qena province and Mahmud Mohammed Shalabi, seven, from
Sohag.


Following the announcement Tuesday of two other children
infected, there were at least half a dozen other cases of minors
stricken by the deadly avian flu virus in March alone.


Women and children have borne the brunt of the virus due to their
role in taking care of domestic fowl. Egypt is the hardest hit by
the virus outside Asia.


The government says it is conducting a vigorous campaign to
combat the spread of the virus through vaccinations and raising
awareness, but cases continue to appear. So far 13 people have
succumbed to the virus.
