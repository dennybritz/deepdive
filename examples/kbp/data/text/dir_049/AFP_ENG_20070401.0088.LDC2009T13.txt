Manly and Melbourne maintained their unbeaten starts to the
National Rugby League season with impressive victories on Sunday.


The Sea Eagles ran in four tries in the final 25 minutes to seal
a 30-8 win over the Sydney Roosters, while Melbourne were too
strong at home for the New Zealand Warriors, who they beat 30-12.


Manly and Melbourne join North Queensland Cowboys and South
Sydney Rabbitohs at the top of the league.


Fullback Brett Stewart scored a double for Manly who overturned a
two-point deficit for their third straight win and leave the
winless Roosters at the bottom of the ladder.


Manly again got the job done without three of their injured stars
-- Matt Orford, Steve Menzies and Steve Matai, with scrum-half
Orford and back-rower Menzies expected to return next week.


Exciting running fullback Billy Slater scored a brace of tries as
the Storm put the Warriors to the sword in Melbourne.


Slater has been the Storm's standout player in the early rounds.
Teenager Israel Folau also continued to make an impression,
scoring another two tries to bring his season's tally to five.


Canterbury Bulldogs broke through for their first win of the
season with a 22-6 victory over competition newcomers Gold Coast.


The Bulldogs scored four tries to the Titans' one, but the 2004
premiers appear well short of the side which made it to within
one game of last year's grand final.
