The father of a young British teacher whose corpse was found
buried in sand in a bathtub appealed Sunday to the Japanese
public to help find a suspect accused over her death.


"My daughter's killer has now brought shame to your country. He
must be caught. He cannot be allowed to hide away," William
Hawker, the father of 22-year-old Lindsay Ann Hawker, said in a
statement read before reporters by British ambassador Graham Fry.


"I still respect this country and its people. I know that you
place great importance on family and community links. So, as a
father, I appeal to you -- if anyone can help the police to find
my daughter's killer, I beg you to come forward."


Police are seeking Tatsuya Ichihashi, 28, who lived in the
apartment where they found Hawker's bruised and naked body buried
in a disconnected bathtub on the balcony on Tuesday.


Police issued an arrest warrant to question the unemployed man,
who dashed off when officers approached him at the apartment.


Ichihashi is accused of abandoning the body. An autopsy found the
English teacher died of suffocation.


News reports have said Ichihashi had been stalking the young
British woman, who nonetheless agreed to give him a private
English lesson.


"We are grateful that the Japanese authorities are doing all that
they can, but they will need the help of the Japanese public to
catch the criminal," the ambassador said.


"I echo the appeal made by Lindsay's father, for anyone who can
help, please, please to come forward," he said.


William Hawker, who is in Japan with his daughter's fiance, has
twice made tearful pleas for the killer to be brought to justice.
