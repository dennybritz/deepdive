An ex-minister of Bangladesh's outgoing ruling party has been
accused of supporting Islamic militants and will face a court
hearing on the charge, police said Sunday.


Former telecom minister Aminul Haq of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party-led and Islamist-allied government, and 28 others were
charged by a citizen named Fazlur Rahman of "conspiring" to
detain and torture him, local police chief Mirza Golam Sarwar
said.


Sarwar said it was the first time a minister has been accused of
supporting militancy.


The case comes days after six top Islamic militants, including
the leader of the outlawed Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB)
were executed in four different jails.


The militants were sentenced to death last year for an attack
that killed two judges in November 2005. Authorities say the JMB
was also behind 400 coordinated blasts that shook the country in
August that year.


The attacks by the JMB were part of a campaign apparently aimed
at forcing Bangladesh to replace its secular legal system, which
dates from the British colonial period, with traditional Islamic
or Sharia law.


Bangladesh's emergency rule government which came to power in
January has pldeged to crack down on corruption and militancy and
has arrested scores of high-profile people.


"We have got some information from the militants. We are finding
out who has given them political support," interim law minister
Mainul Hosein said.
