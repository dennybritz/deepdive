Head coach Orjan Madsen Sunday slammed his limp German team's
performance at the world championships, saying a gap has
increased between his swimmers and the leading nations.


The Germans, who came here with expectations of success in the
wake of world record times by their women swimmers, led by Britta
Steffen, at last year's European championships, failed to win a
single gold.


That ranked them 13th overall on the medal tally behind the
United States, Australia and France.


"The reality is that we stayed far behind our expectations. We
expected a much better performance than our athletes showed,"
Madsen said.


"We need to change things. We swam too slow and the world class
athletes swam faster than we expected. The gap has increased.


"These results are possibly an advantage. If something goes
wrong, people are more eager to question themselves in order to
find out what went wrong and what needs to be done in the future.
"


Madsen said cultural differences were exposed at the
championships between his swimmers and the Americans.


"Some of the media have compared us to the United States and
pointed out how relaxed and self-confident they are," he said.


"The way we sit here today, which feels like a funeral, shows the
cultural differences between us and the United States."


"It can be said that we swim on a world class level. But if we
want to compete on a world class level, we'll need to behave in a
way that it looks like we want to be world class.


"Our problem is that we lose focus easily. We focus on minor
things like swimsuits. But we'll need to focus on things that
will make us improve by seconds."
