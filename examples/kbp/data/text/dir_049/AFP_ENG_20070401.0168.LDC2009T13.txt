South Korean schools were told to consider shutting down after a
nationwide warning on Sunday against potentially toxic yellow
dust blowing in from China and Mongolia.


The education ministry issued a special notice urging local
education authorities to cancel or shorten classes if the warning
continues until Monday.


Officials at the Korea Meteorological Administration said the
dust blanketed much of the country on Sunday, with visibility in
the capital Seoul at just three kilometres (two miles).


Nursery and elememtary schools in the southeastern province of
South Kyongsang decided to close on Monday, while schools in
other regions were considering following suit, according to
Yonhap news agency.


Yellow dust -- fine sand from Mongolia's Gobi Desert which
sometimes includes toxic chemical smog emitted by Chinese
factories -- usually hits South Korea in the spring. It can cause
respiratory disorders.
