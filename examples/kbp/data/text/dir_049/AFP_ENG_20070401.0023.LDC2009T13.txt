Suspected Islamic separatists operating in Thailand's insurgency-
torn south have shot and killed two Muslim men in separate
attacks, police said Sunday.


A villager, 29, was shot dead Saturday night as he travelled home
from a local mosque in Narathiwat, one of three southern
provinces where more than 2,000 people have been killed in three
years of separatist unrest.


On Sunday morning, a 30-year-old volunteer solider was killed
when a group of militants opened fire on his motorcycle as he
drove to work in the same province.


The violence in the Muslim-majority southern provinces bordering
Malaysia has worsened since a coup last year, despite a series of
peace initiatives by the army-installed government.
