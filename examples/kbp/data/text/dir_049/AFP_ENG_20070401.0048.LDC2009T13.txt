Somber and visibly moved, German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid
homage to the victims of the Nazis during a visit to the Yad
Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem on Sunday.


Dressed in a black pant suit, the chancellor stood with her head
bowed as a children's choir sang during a ceremony at the hall of
remembrance, where she laid a wreath.


"Humanity grows out of the responsibility of the past," the 52
-year-old German leader wrote in the museum guestbook.


Some six million Jews are estimated to have perished in the
Holocaust at the hands of the Nazis during World War II.
