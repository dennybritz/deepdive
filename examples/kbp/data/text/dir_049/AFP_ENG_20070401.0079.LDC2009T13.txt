England manager Steve McClaren has sent out a defiant message to
his detractors, claiming they will not drive him out of the
coveted national team post.


McClaren came under fire during and after the latest round of
Euro 2008 qualifying matches, where England took four points from
a possible six against Israel and Andorra.


But he was roundly jeered by fans at the Andorra match and faced
mounting criticism in the press for England's lacklustre
showings.


He told the News of the World: "I won't let some hateful mob
drive me out of this job. I have work to do and I'm not leaving
until I've done it.


"Even when the abuse was at its worst it never crossed my mind
that this could be my last match with England. I did not consider
walking away - not for a moment.


"I don't believe I will ever get abuse as bad as that again in my
life, but when I look back on that experience, I feel I have
emerged stronger."


McClaren also revealed how he tried to inspire his players to a
better second- half performance - which eventually resulted in
three unanswered goals.


"When I got the players together at half-time I impressed on them
that if things went wrong it would be me who took the stick.


"I told them I can handle it, so they should go out, forget the
atmosphere in the stadium and do their best to win."
