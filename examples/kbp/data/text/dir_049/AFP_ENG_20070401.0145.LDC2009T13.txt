Britain expressed "continuing regret" Sunday over deaths on both
sides in the Falklands War and said families of dead Argentine
service personnel could hold a commemorative event on the
islands.


In a statement issued the day before the 25th anniversary of
Argentina's invasion, Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said
that the memorial could be held at the Argentine cemetery in
Darwin "towards the end of 2007".
