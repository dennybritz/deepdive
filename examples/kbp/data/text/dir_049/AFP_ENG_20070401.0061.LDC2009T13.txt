A bomb attack caused major damage to a town hall building on the
French Mediterranean island of Corsica early Sunday but no-one
was injured, the interior security services said.


A "highly-charged" bomb hidden on the ground floor of the
building in Ghisonaccia, northern Corsica, went off around 1:30
am (2330 GMT Saturday), causing "major damage to the festivities
room," said a spokesman for the security services.


There was no-one in the building at the time of the explosion.


Corsica has been plagued by more than 30 years of low-level
violence waged by separatists opposed to French rule.
