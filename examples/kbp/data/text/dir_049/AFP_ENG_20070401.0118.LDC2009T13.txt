Iran has formally protested at what it called a "British
shootout" around its consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra, amid a
standoff over Tehran's seizure of 15 Britons, local media
reported on Sunday.


"Following British forces' movements and shootout around the
Iranian consulate in Basra the foreign ministry submitted a note
of protest to the British embassy in Tehran" on March 30, the
ministry said in a statement.


It added that Iran called for "prevention of such acts happening
again and for the British forces in Iraq to respect international
law regarding diplomatic places."


The Iranian consulate in Basra accused British troops of storming
the consulate and surrounding its office during a shootout with
gunmen last Thursday.


The British military denied any such incident occurred, saying
its soldiers had come under small arms fire during a routine
patrol in the vicinity of the Iranian consulate but did not leave
their vehicles.


Tehran and London are in dispute over Iran's detention of 15
British sailors and marines it arrested in the disputed Shatt al-
Arab waterway between Iran and Iraq on March 23.


Iran says the Britons illegally entered its territorial waters
while London insists they were in Iraqi waters on a anti-
smuggling patrol under UN mandate.
