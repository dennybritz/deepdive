Michael Phelps' quest for a record eight gold medals at the world
championships ended Sunday when the United States team was
disqualified in the heats of the 4x100-metres medley relay.


The Americans won their heat but there were loud gasps from the
crowd when the semaphore board displayed that the US team had
been disqualified and therefore will miss out on Sunday's final.


It was not clear why they were disqualified. Japan were the
fastest into the final.


Phelps, who has already equalled Ian Thorpe's championship record
of six golds, did not swim in the heats but was expected to swim
in the final to go after what could have been his eighth gold
medal.


He had earlier qualified fastest for the final of the 400m
individual medley Sunday.
