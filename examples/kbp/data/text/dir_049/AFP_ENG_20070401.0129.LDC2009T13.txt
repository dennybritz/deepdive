One person was killed and three were injured Sunday by an
explosion on a minibus near the Azerbaijani capital Baku, police
said.


About 12 passengers were on the bus at the time of the blast,
which occurred 36 kilometres (22 miles) south of Baku, a police
spokesman, who requested anonymity, told AFP.


"The preliminary version of events is that one of the passengers
had carried explosive materials onto the bus," he said. An
investigation has been launched.
