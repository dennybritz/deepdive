Suspected Islamic militants Sunday shot dead a senior worker from
Indian Kashmir's ruling party and a soldier was killed died in a
separate gun battle with rebels, police said.


Jan Mohammed Kakroo was shot several times by masked gunmen in
the town of Baramulla, about 55 kilometres (34 miles) north of
the summer capital Srinagar as he was returning home from a
revered shrine, police officer Abdullah Wani told AFP.


Muslims Sunday marked the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed at
shrines and mosques across Kashmir.


Kakroo was a member of the Congress party which leads India's
federal coalition government and is in alliance with a regional
party in Kashmir.


Further north, militants killed an Indian soldier Sunday in an
exchange of fire, a police spokesman said.


Kashmir is in the grip of a 17-year-old insurgency that has left
more than 42,000 people dead by official count.


Human rights groups put the toll at 70,000, while separatists say
nearly 100,000 people have died in the unrest.
