Reigning sprint champion Theo Bos will defend his crown against
France's Gregory Bauge here in the final of the world track
cycling championships on Sunday.


Bos dominated Britain's Craig MacLean, last year's silver
medallist, over two semi-final legs while Bauge beat out fancied
compatriot Mickael Bourgain in a tight third leg decider.


Bos, one of the Netherlands' gold medal hopes in the sprint and
keirin at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, will now meet Bauge in the
race to decide the gold medal.


Bourgain will face MacLean in the race for the bronze medal.


The 26-year-old Bourgain is in the form of his life and was
widely expected to make the final.


Bauge admitted the lack of pressure on him was a boost during
their three-leg thriller.


"I didn't have any pressure on me, so I was relaxed," said Bauge,
born in Paris to parents from the French Caribbean island of
Guadeloupe.


"I think we gave the fans a good race."


In the semis of the 2005 championships in Los Angeles Bauge's
final bid came undone when he punctured while racing Bourgain.


"That's two years of waiting to get to a world championship final
over," added Bauge, who last year was unceremoniously eliminated
in the early rounds by Italian Roberto Chiappa.


Now he is ready to beat the Bos man.


"He's the favourite? Well I'm the favourite too then," he added.


"I've raced him only once before, during my first year in the
elite (World Cup). I hope I'll show him I've grown up a bit since
then."
