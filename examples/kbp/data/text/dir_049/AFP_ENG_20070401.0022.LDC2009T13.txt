A senior Pakistani lawmaker has called on Iran to free 15 British
sailors and marines as a "humanitarian gesture," saying they
should not be blamed for the policies of their government.


Mushahid Hussain Sayed, a key ruling party figure and head of the
Pakistani parliament's foreign relations committee, said the 14
men and one woman should not be punished for the "mistakes and
wrong policies of their government."


His comments to Iran's ambassador, Mashallah Shakiri, were
released by the ruling Pakistan Muslim League in a statement.


Sayed urged Iran to seek the "moral high ground and defuse
tension in the region by this humanitarian gesture."


Captured in the Gulf on March 23, the navy personnel are being
held in a secret location and occasionally shown on television
allegedly confessing to and apologizing for their transgressions.


Britain insists that they were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol
in Iraqi waters under a UN mandate when they were taken, but Iran
says they were in its territorial waters.
