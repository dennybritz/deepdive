The new archbishop of Warsaw formally assumed his duties Sunday,
ending a saga which started in January when the pope's original
appointment resigned amid reports he had been a communist
informer.


The new appointee is Kazimierz Nycz, 57, the former bishop of
Koszalin-Kolobrzeg in northern Poland and a strong supporter of
the "decommunisation" of the Polish Church.


He replaced Stanislaw Wielgus, bishop of Plock and the Vatican's
first choice to succeed Cardinal Jozef Glemp as the primate of
the Roman Catholic Church in Poland.


Wielgus, 67, announced at what was to have been his formal
investiture at Warsaw Cathedral that he was resigning because of
accusations about his past during the communist period.


His move followed reports in the Polish media backed by documents
that Wielgus received special agent training from the Polish
state security from 1967 to 1987, just before the communist
regime collapsed.
