South Korea on Sunday issued a nationwide warning against yellow
dust blowing in from China and Mongolia, advising citizens to
stay indoors to avoid the choking mix of sand and pollutants.


Officials at the Korea Meteorological Administration said the
dust had blanketed much of the country on Sunday, with visibility
in the capital Seoul at just three kilometres (two miles).


Yellow dust -- fine sand from Mongolia's Gobi Desert which
sometimes includes toxic chemical smog emitted by Chinese
factories -- usually hits South Korea in the spring. It can cause
respiratory disorders.
