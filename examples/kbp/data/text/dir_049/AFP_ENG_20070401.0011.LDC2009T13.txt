Nepal's mainstream political parties have reached agreement
Sunday with former Maoist rebels to form a government and cement
a landmark peace deal, officials said.


"The eight party leaders during today's session have agreed to
give the senior most post (after the prime minister) to the
Nepali Congress," said Amod Prasad Upadhyay, a senior Nepali
Congress leader.


The wrangling between an alliance of seven political parties and
the former rebels over key positions including the deputy
leadership post had delayed the formation of the new cabinet, in
which the Maoists will hold five portfolios.


The government was to be formally approved by parliament on
Sunday.


"We are all now heading to parliament," Upadhyay said.
