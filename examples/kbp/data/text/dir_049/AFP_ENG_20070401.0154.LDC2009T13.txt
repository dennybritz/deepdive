American Katie Hoff produced a world record to claim her third
gold medal of the world championships in the 400-metre individual
medley on Sunday.


Hoff carved 0.70secs off Ukraine's Yana Klochkova's seven-year-
old world mark to set a new record at four minutes 32.89 seconds.


"I just cannot believe it. I heard the crowd during the race and
thought 'I must have been good'. Then I saw the board. It is a
dream come true," Hoff said.


"I am so excited. I have done so well. I have worked so hard."


She blitzed the field, beating silver-medallist Yana Martynova of
Russia by almost seven and a half seconds with Australian
Stephanie Rice taking the bronze.


Hoff won the 200m medley in a championship record time of 2:10.13
on Monday and was also a member of the American 4x200m freestyle
team that won gold on Thursday.


She is unbeaten in the event over the past two years and is the
raging favourite for the medley events at next year's Beijing
Olympics.
