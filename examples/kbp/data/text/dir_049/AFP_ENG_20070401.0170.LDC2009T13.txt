EU president German Chancellor Angela Merkel began talks on
Sunday with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in the West Bank
city of Ramallah.


Merkel met the Palestinian leader after holding two rounds of
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jerusalem during
her second leg of a regional tour.


The German chacellor was to meet with the Israeli premier for a
third time later on Sunday.


Earlier Merkel, whose country currently holds the rotating
presidency of the European Union, urged Middle East nations to
seize the moment and move the stalled peace process forward.


Merkel held talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman on
Saturday and was due to wrap up her tour in Lebanon.
