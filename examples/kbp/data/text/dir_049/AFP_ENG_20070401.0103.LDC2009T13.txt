Architect Lawrence Wilfred Baker, credited with building
thousands of low-cost houses in India, died at his home in the
south of the country Sunday at the age of 90, his family said.


Baker, popularly known as Laurie, was considered a pioneer in
building cost- effective and environment-friendly houses for poor
Indians by using traditional techniques, materials and crafts
such as mud and thatch.


Born on March 2, 1917 in England, Baker came to India during
British colonial rule in the mid-1940s and later settled with his
Indian wife Elizabeth near Thiruvananthapuram, capital of
southeastern Kerala state.


He was honoured with one of India's top civilian awards, the
Padmashree in 1990, the same year he became an Indian citizen.


Baker also served on the panels of several government bodies.


He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.
