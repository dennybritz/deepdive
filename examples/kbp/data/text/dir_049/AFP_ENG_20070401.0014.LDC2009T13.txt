Retired swimming star Ian Thorpe on Sunday protested his
innocence and said he was confident he would be cleared of doping
allegations against him.


"I have never cheated and I pride myself on my record,"
Australia's most decorated Olympian told a press conference.


"I firmly believe I am clean, I have never cheated and have
always fulfilled my obligations.


"My reputation has already been tarnished and it is the hardest
thing to take.


"I was physically shaking in my room when I heard the news, it is
gut wrenching, it really is.


"I believe there will be an innocent explanation for it all. My
doctor is preparing a list of all the medicines I might have
taken at that time."


Thorpe was forced back into the spotlight on Saturday following
revelations that swimming governing body, FINA, was aiming to
reopen a case surrounding high levels of naturally-occurring
hormones in one of his doping tests.


Thorpe, who dominated world swimming for eight years, said he was
alarmed that the test analysis and his name was leaked to a
French newspaper.


"I am deeply alarmed that the test was leaked to the press," said
the 24-year- old.


"It jeopardises the whole integrity of the testing procedure and
there are many innocent explanations of this.


"I have been deprived of this privacy protection and I can only
speculate to the motives."
