Bird flu has struck two poultry farms in Vietnam's far south,
killing 65 ducks and forcing the slaughter of 20 more, state
media and veterinary officials said Sunday.


The latest cases were reported by the animal health department
just days after Vietnam said there had been no new outbreaks in
21 days, the time period after which an epidemic is technically
considered contained.


The 65 ducks, which were 20 days old and unvaccinated, began
dying on March 22 on two small farms in Khanh Binh Dong commune
of Ca Mau province and later tested positive for the H5N1 strain
of the bird flu virus, said the department.


Avian flu hit Vietnam from late 2003, killing 42 people over the
next two years and devastating the poultry industry, but
authorities contained the epidemic and no new human cases have
been reported since November 2005.


The virus reappeared among poultry this winter after a one-year
hiatus, striking mostly unvaccinated chicken and ducks in the
country's southern Mekong Delta region and in recent months
hitting farms in the country's north.


Bird flu has killed at least 170 people worldwide, according to
World Health Organization figures. Experts fear it could trigger
a pandemic if it mutates to pass easily among humans.
