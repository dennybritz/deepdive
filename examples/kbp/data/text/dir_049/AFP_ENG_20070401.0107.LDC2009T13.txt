American Jessica Hardy prevented Australia's Leisel Jones from
completing a breaststroke treble with victory in the 50m final at
the world championships on Sunday.


Hardy, who won silver in the event at the 2005 Montreal world
titles, hit the wall in 30.63 seconds.


Jones, who completed the 100/200m breaststroke double at the
meet, was second in 30.70 with American Tara Kirk taking the
bronze in 31.05.


"It's my personal best and probably an American record," Hardy
said. "I just felt very strong.


"These are great competitors. It's a great accomplishment, it is
a great honour."


For Jones it was a rousing finish to a great home world
championship meet with three gold medals.


"It is a great finish off for me. I have had an exciting week,"
Jones said.


"Jessica is great on the 50m. I knew she'd be fast. It's always
great to race her. She is an awesome competitor."
