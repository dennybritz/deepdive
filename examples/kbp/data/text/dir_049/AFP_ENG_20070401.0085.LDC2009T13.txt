Gerhard Zandberg claimed the 50-metres backstroke for South
Africa's second gold medal of the world championships on Sunday.


Zandberg, who won silver in the event at Barcelona in 2003,
clocked 24.98 seconds to beat Germany's Thomas Rupprath.


Rupprath holds the world record of 24.80 when he won the gold
medal at Barcelona 2003.


"I am so happy. It's been a real struggle for the little swim
team that we have," Zandberg said.


"I spent so many years in the pool giving up so many things. Here
and now, it is all worth it."


Britain's Liam Tancock, who was the fastest qualifier in the
semi-finals, was third in 25.23.
