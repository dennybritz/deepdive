Michael Phelps won a record seventh gold medal at the world
swimming championships with a world record victory in the
400-metres individual medley on Sunday.


It was the 21-year-old American phenomenon's fifth world record
of the week as he carved just over two seconds off his 2004 world
mark with a sensational swim in four minutes 06.22 seconds.


He overpowered teammate Ryan Lochte (4:09.74) to win by three and
a half seconds.


"I saw at 150m I was 0.1 under the record. It's the last race and
I wanted to finish off strong," Phelps said.


He was denied eight gold medals here when the American team was
disqualified in the 4x100m medley relay heats for an early
changeover.


It was the first time the United States have missed out on a
relay final in world championship history.


"When Team USA comes into a swimming meet, we come as a team and
we exit as a team. We would rather do it now than next year (at
Beijing)," said Phelps.


Phelps equalled Ian Thorpe's six golds at a world championship
when he pipped world champion Crocker in Saturday's 100m
butterfly final.


He now leaves Australia in great shape for his assault on Mark
Spitz's 1972 Olympics record of seven gold medals at next year's
Beijing Games.


"There is still more work to be done next year," Phelps said.


It was his 20th medal at the world championships, the most by any
swimmer, after passing Australian Grant Hackett (18) at this
meet.


Phelps won the 400m medley at the 2004 Athens Olympics and
previously won the world title at Barcelona 2003 but left it off
his schedule two years later in Montreal.


His previous world record was set in Athens.
