Croatia won its first water polo gold medal in world championship
history Sunday, pulling off an upset overtime defeat of Hungary.


Croatia's Pavo Markovic scored his side's two goals in extra time
to seal a 9-8 victory and delight a vocal and mostly pro-Croatian
crowd after the score was 7-7 at the end of regulation time.


But goalkeeper Frano Vican was the true hero, pulling off some
stunning saves, including a blinder late in the final term which
helped Croatia push the match into extra time.


"From the beginning we knew we had a chance, and to be honest we
didn't know if we could win gold but any medal would have done,"
said Croatia's Mile Smodlaka.


"We didn't lose our heads during extra-time - we kept
concentrating and that's the main thing. I still can't believe
that we won."


Damir Buric added: "It was really hard, really physical. When you
play a team like Hungary you know it won't be easy.


"To be honest I thought we played better than them but when we
were two goals down I knew it would be hard to fight back."


Hungary are a traditional powerhouse of the sport and winner of
the past two Olympic gold medals.


Spain took the bronze medal, prevailing in a marathon penalty
shootout against Serbia, after Italy had earned fifth place with
a shootout win over Greece.
