Australia capitalised on America's shock disqualification to win
the men's 4x100m medley relay gold medal at the world
championships on Sunday.


The disqualification of the US team in the morning heats for an
incorrect changeover cost Michael Phelps the prospect of an
unprecedented eight gold medals and left the field open.


Australia seized their opportunity with Eamon Sullivan powering
home in the freestyle leg to overtake Japan.


The Australian team of Matt Welsh, Brenton Rickard, Andrew
Lauterstein and Sullivan won in three minutes 34.93 seconds for
the first gold for the Australian men's team, who have played
second fiddle at the championships to the Libby Lenton and Leisel
Jones-led women's team.


Japan, whose led for most of the race thanks to a great
breaststroke leg by Kosuke Kitajima, finished with silver in
3:35.16 and Russia third in 3:35.51.


Russia and Japan were runners-up to the United States at the 2003
and 2005 world championships.


It was the first time the United States missed out on any relay
final in world championship history.


Australia are two-time world champions and are the only country
other than the United States to have held the medley relay world
title.
