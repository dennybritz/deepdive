Nagoya Grampus Eight came back from a goal down to beat Yokohama
FC 2-1 on Sunday, maintaining their 100 percent record and narrow
J-League lead.


Nagoya went a goal down to Hiroaki Namba's strike before Keita
Sugimoto equalised and Kei Yamaguchi hit the winner -- all in the
space of four second- half minutes.


Nagoya lead the J-League by just one goal's difference from Gamba
Osaka, who have also won all four of their opening matches.


"It was a good match. It was a result of what everybody worked
really hard for, and we kept our strategic discipline very well,"
said Nagoya's Dutch coach Sef Vergoossen.


Nagoya and Gamba are two points ahead of Kashiwa Reysol, with
Shimizu S-Pulse and Jubilo Iwata both three points off the lead.


In Sunday's other match, defending champions Urawa Red Diamonds
conceded in injury time to be held 2-2 by Oita Trinita.


It was deja vu for Urawa, who lost two goals in the last two
minutes to draw with Albirex Niigata 2-2 three weeks ago.


Urawa are now four points behind Nagoya and Gamba with two wins
and two draws.


On Saturday, Osaka defeated Ventforet Kofu 2-1, while Kashiwa
blanked FC Tokyo 2-0. Shimizu downed Omiya Ardija 2-1 and Iwata
whitewashed JEF United Chiba 1-0.
