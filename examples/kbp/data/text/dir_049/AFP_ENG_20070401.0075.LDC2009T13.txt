Nepal's Maoists were sworn into a new interim government on
Sunday, witnesses said, in a major step forward for a peace
process that ended a decade of civil war in the nation.


The former rebels hold five portfolios in a 22-member cabinet
tasked with steering the impoverished Himalayan nation into new
elections in June.


The new ministers read out an oath in parliament that they would
be "committed and responsible for the sovereignty of the nation
and the people," an AFP reporter at the scene said.


The rebels signed a peace deal with the country's mainstream
parties in November and have vowed to end their violence.


Veteran Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala -- the architect of
the peace deal and leader of the Nepali Congress party -- retains
his position as premier.
