An avalanche in remote, northern Pakistan killed at least 23
people and another 14 were still missing, police said Sunday.


The avalanche buried 26 houses in snow in Washik Chitral Tor
village, some 150 kilometres (93 miles) north of the town of
Chitral late on Saturday, local police official Ali Khan said.


"Twenty-three bodies have been taken out from the snow and
rubble, 14 others were still missing and six others were pulled
out alive," Khan told AFP.


Rescue efforts were hampered by routes closed due to heavy
snowfall in the region. Authorities were arranging for
helicopters to send relief supplies and help search for the
missing, he said.
