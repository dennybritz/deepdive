Reigning sprint champion Theo Bos will defend his crown against
France's Gregory Bauge here in the final of the world track
cycling championships on Sunday.


Bos dominated Britain's Craig MacLean, last year's silver
medallist, over two semi-final legs while Bauge beat out fancied
compatriot Mickael Bourgain in a tight third leg decider.


Bos, one of the Netherlands' gold medal hopes in the sprint and
keirin at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, will now meet Paris-based
Frenchman Bauge in the race to decide the gold medal.


Bourgain will face MacLean in the race for the bronze medal.
