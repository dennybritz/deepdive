Britain expressed "continuing regret" Sunday over deaths on both
sides in the Falklands War and said families of dead Argentine
service personnel could hold a commemorative event on the
islands.


In a statement issued the day before the 25th anniversary of
Argentina's invasion, Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said
that the memorial could be held at the Argentine cemetery in
Darwin "towards the end of 2007".


"April 2 marks the 25th anniversary of the Argentine invasion of
the Falklands. The resulting loss of life on both sides is a
source of continuing regret," Beckett said.


"We have now, with the agreement of the Falkland Islands
government, offered members of families of the Argentine armed
forces who fell in 1982 the opportunity to travel to the islands
towards the end of 2007 to hold a private commemorative event at
the Argentine cemetery in Darwin."


Beckett added that Britain was keen to "foster a constructive
relationship" with Argentina and to promote cooperation in the
South Atlantic and on broader international affairs.


Britain and Argentina went to war after Argentina's military
government, headed by General Leopoldo Galtieri, invaded the
islands.


Britain retook the islands within a couple of months, after
sending a task force down to the remote south Atlantic, cementing
the no-nonsense reputation of then prime minister Margaret
Thatcher.
