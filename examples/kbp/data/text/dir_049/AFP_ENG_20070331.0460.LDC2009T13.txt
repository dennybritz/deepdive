North Korea's state media accused the United States and South
Korea of carrying out 160 spy flights against the communist state
last month.


The Korean Central News Agency said US espionage planes carried
out 110 spy missions in March and South Korean aircraft a further
50.


It denounced the "aerial espionage acts" as "a grave military
provocation" that infringed on its national sovereignty, in a
report carried late Saturday.


North Korea has routinely reported the alleged spy flights
although US and South Korean military authorities have refused to
comment.


The United States and South Korea staged a week-long joint
military drill that ended on Thursday. The North claimed the
exercise was to plan attacks on it while US officials said it was
purely defensive.


Joining the exercise were the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier,
a cruiser and two destroyers as well as tens of thousands of US
and South Korean troops.


Currently some 29,500 US troops are stationed here to assist
680,000 South Korean forces facing up to North Korea's 1.1
-million-strong military.


The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950-1953
conflict ended in a fragile armistice.
