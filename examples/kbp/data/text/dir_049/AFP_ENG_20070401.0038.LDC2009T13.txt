North Korea has deployed new high-speed navy ships similar to
hovercraft, a news report said Sunday.


The vessels carry 56-millimetre and 30-millimetre machine guns,
the Yonhap news agency said citing unidentified military
officials, and can travel on air cushions at speeds of up to 90
kilometres (56 miles) per hour.


Yonhap said Seoul has still to verify how many such ships North
Korea has built but that Pyongyang may want to sell them to other
nations.


The North's navy operates about 130 hovercraft which are used for
transport rather than designed as battle craft, according to
Seoul's defence ministry.


The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950-1953
conflict ended in a fragile armistice.


Around 680,000 South Korean forces, backed by 29,500 US soldiers,
face the North Korea's 1.1-million-strong military.
