Sri Lankan supersonic jets and helicopter gunships bombed
suspected Tamil Tiger positions in the island's northeast Sunday
as violence continued in the bitter ethnic conflict, the military
said.


Fighter aircraft hit a "Sea Tiger" base in the Mullaitivu region
on Saturday while another was bombed under the cover of darkness
on Sunday, the military said in a statement.


Ukranian-built Mi-24 helicopter gunships attacked a suspected
Tamil Tiger mortar bomb position near the de facto border
separating the two forces in the northern district of Vavuniya
early Sunday, the statement said.


The night-time air strikes came a week after the Tamil Tiger
rebels staged a daring raid on the island's main military airbase
using two light aircraft and managed to escape unchallenged.


They also followed two separate roadside bombs attacks that
killed a police commando and wounded five others Saturday, the
military said.


Military officials said the guerrillas and troops exchanged fire
across the northern and eastern regions at the weekend.


There was no immediate reaction from the Tigers to the air
strikes but in a statement Sunday they claimed the air force had
dropped bombs near a school earlier in the week.


The rebels have waged a 35-year campaign for independence that
has claimed more than 60,000 lives.


More than 4,000 people have been killed in the latest upsurge of
fighting that began in December 2005 despite a truce arranged in
2002.
