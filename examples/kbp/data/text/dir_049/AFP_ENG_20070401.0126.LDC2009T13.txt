Rescuers located the bodies of 10 miners Sunday after a six-day
search in a southwestern China coal mine rocked by a gas
explosion last week, state press reported.


Rescue operations at the Wangjiazhai coal mine in Guizhou
province were called off early Sunday after the bodies were
found, Xinhua news agency said.


The explosion occurred in the state-owned mine on Tuesday
morning, the report said.


An investigation into the blast was ongoing, it added.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
