Rescuers have located the bodies of three workers who died when a
tunnel collapsed at the construction site of Beijing's Olympic
subway line, state press reported Sunday.


It brings the confirmed death toll since the collapse Wednesday
morning to four, with another two workers still missing.


The three workers just located were buried under collapsed
concrete making it impossible for rescuers to immediately pull
out their bodies, Xinhua news agency reported.


Ten people have been detained by authorities over the accident
amid claims of a cover-up by the construction company. They
include the supervisor and the designers of the subway tunnel,
while police are still looking for the labour contractor, it
added.


The state-run construction company tried to conceal the incident
and waited at least eight hours before notifying authorities,
Xinhua's report said.


The project is part of a 40 billion dollar spending spree to get
Beijing's infrastructure up to speed in time for the August 2008
Games.


The accident occurred in the city's Haidian university district
on the No. 10 subway line, which will connect to the Olympic
Village north of Beijing.


It was unclear whether the accident would affect the completion
timetable.


Beijing is building four subway lines as well as a light rail
line to the city airport that are all slated to be finished
before the Games.
