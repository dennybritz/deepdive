Bones from the tomb of Slovakia's controversial WWII president
have been dug up so DNA tests can establish whether he is really
buried there, it was reported on Sunday.


Doubts continue about the final resting place of Jozef Tiso, a
Catholic priest who headed the wartime Slovak state allied to
Nazi Germany.


According to some theories, his bones were taken in the 1970's by
the secret police of former Czechoslovakia, burned and then
scattered.


The DNA samples were taken from Bratislava cemetery at the
request of the Andrej Hlinka Association, the Aktualne online
daily reported.


The association honours the memory of another Catholic priest who
fought first against Hungarian domination and then for Slovak
autonomy within Czechoslovakia before WWII.


The tomb was opened while work on a new 200,000-koruna
(6,000-euro, 8,000-dollar) memorial to Tiso was taking place, the
daily said.


Tiso's place in history is an emotive subject in the former
communist country.


Some praise him for founding the first modern Slovak independent
state but others point to the price of Nazi collaboration, which
included the transportation of around 70,000 Slovak Jews to
Hitler's death camps.


The 60th anniversary of Tiso's execution takes place on April 18.
