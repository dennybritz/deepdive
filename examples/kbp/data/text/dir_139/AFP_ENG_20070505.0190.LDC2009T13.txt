Three people were killed and 18 feared dead in an explosion at a
chemical factory in western India, police said on Saturday.


"We found three bodies. We are still looking for about 18 people
who have been declared missing," Nikhil Gupta, police
superintendent of Nashik town, told AFP by phone.


A police source said those missing were "in all probability
dead."


"Until the bodies are found, they cannot be officially declared
dead," the police official told AFP on condition of anonymity.


Five workers were taken to hospital after the three-storey
facility collapsed late Friday in western Maharashtra state,
Gupta said.


"In all, there were 38 people working on the premises when the
explosion happened. We have counted 12 people who are safe with
no injuries from the blast," he added.


The factory produced explosives for the construction industry.


The cause of the blast was being investigated with an interim
report due Sunday, Gupta said.


"We are treating this as a matter of accidental death."
