Lebanon's Hezbollah has rebuilt its defences to face any new
attack from Israel, the Shiite militant movement's deputy chief
said in an interview with Al-Jazeera news channel.


"We have new (military) plans. We have completed ... our ground
work in preparing our men, as well as our land, so that we would
be ready if the Israeli (government) thought one day" of
launching another attack, Sheikh Naim Qassim said in excerpts of
the interview aired on Saturday.


"We have evaluated the events of the second war on Lebanon ...
and looked at the points of strength and weakness in a way that
we would learn from the results of this war," he said referring
to Israel's devastating 34-day offensive last summer sparked by
Hezbollah's capture of two Israeli soldiers.


The full interview will be broadcast later on Saturday.


On Monday, an Israeli probe accused Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
and Israel's top army brass of "serious failure" in handling the
war with Hezbollah, prompting calls on Olmert to step down.


Under the terms of a UN-brokered truce which ended the war,
however, a beefed-up UN peacekeeping force is patrolling the
volatile border area along with Lebanese soldiers, meant to keep
Hezbollah away from the frontier.


Lebanese authorities say that Hezbollah continues to have a
presence in the area, but no arms or military equipment are
visible.
