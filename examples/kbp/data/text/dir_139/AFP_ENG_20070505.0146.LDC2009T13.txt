President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Saturday that imposing
further UN resolutions against Iran will not make it stop its
disputed nuclear programme, the student ISNA news agency
reported.


"I tell them -- issue as many resolutions until you get tired,"
he said of world powers in the UN Security Council that has
adopted two resolutions imposing sanctions on Tehran for its
defiance in continuing to enrich uranium.


Ahmadinejad has repeatedly vowed that Iran will not back down an
inch on its nuclear programme which the West fears to be a cover
for weapons development.


"There are a few powers that have this (nuclear) technology and
are angry that another country has come to join them. They know
if Iran passes this peak it cannot be rivalled," Ahmadinejad
said.


"We have to be able to go past this bottleneck, but they want to
adopt resolutions to stop it."


Iran has begun installing thousands of centrifuges for uranium
enrichment -- the process which makes nuclear fuel but which in
highly purified form can also produce the fissile core of an
atomic bomb.


The United States accuses Iran of seeking to make nuclear
weapons, but Tehran insists that it wants only to generate more
energy for a growing population.
