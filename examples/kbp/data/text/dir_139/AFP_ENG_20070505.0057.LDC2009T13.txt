Asian finance ministers agreed Saturday on a foreign currency
reserve pooling system to make it easier to borrow emergency
funds to guard against speculative attacks.


Finance ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) as well as China, Japan and South Korea agreed to work
toward a multi-nation scheme of currency swaps to improve the
existing system introduced in 2000.


"We unanimously agreed in principle that a self-managed reserve
pooling arrangement governed by single contractual agreements is
an appropriate form of multi-lateralization," said the final
document released from the meeting.


"We recognised the consensus reached as a significant achievement
towards an advanced framework of regional liquidity support
mechanism," it said.
