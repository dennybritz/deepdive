Thousands of people flocked into the European Union's main
institutions Saturday as doors were opened to the public to mark
more than half a century since the first move toward the bloc's
creation.


Concerts were staged at the European Commission's Berlaymont
headquarters, debates held at the nearby European Parliament and
visitors invited into the chambers were the EU's big decisions
are made at the European Council.


Queen Paola of Belgium led a host of dignitaries and senior
officials, notably touring the Commission's Berlaymont's
headquarters with the institution's President Jose Manuel
Barroso.


After visiting an exhibition marking the Treaty of Rome, the EU's
founding document signed 50 years ago, she received an art book
dedicated by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.


Other EU officials and commissioners were out in force, fielding
questions from the public. It had been hoped that 30,000 people
would visit.


Children in particular were well catered for, with animals, play
areas and a make-up stand as well as stands explaining ways in
which the 27-member bloc works.


Saturday's events coincided with the "Europe Day" anniversary --
May 9, 1950 -- when French foreign minister Robert Schuman urged
nations to pool their coal and steel production, a first base on
which to build European integration.
