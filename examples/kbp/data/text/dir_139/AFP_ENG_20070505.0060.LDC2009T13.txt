Iran has hanged two men convicted of drug trafficking in the
southern town of Roodan in Hormozgan province, the student ISNA
news agency reported on Saturday.


The report identified the men as Afghan Zaer H., 30, found guilty
of smuggling two kilos (4.4 pounds) of heroin, and Iranian Majid
S., convicted of trafficking 44 kilos (97 pounds) of opium and 97
kilos (213 pounds) of cannabis.


It did not say whether the executions were carried out in public
or in prison.


The hangings brought to at least 52 the number of executions
carried out in Iran so far this year. At least 177 people were
executed in 2006, according to an Amnesty International report.


Capital offences in the Islamic republic include murder, rape,
armed robbery, apostasy, blasphemy, serious drug trafficking,
repeated sodomy, adultery or prostitution, treason and espionage.
