A small bomb exploded in the Thai capital Bangkok on Saturday
near the former headquarters of deposed premier Thaksin
Shinawatra's political party, slightly injuring one man, police
said.


The bomb went off inside a phone booth, said Colonel Supisan
Bhakdinarunat, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police
Department.


The blast injured the hand of a 22-year-old man who was trying to
use the phone.


"The bomb went off around 9:20 pm (1420 GMT), injuring one
person," the police spokesman said.


He declined to give further details, including the type of bomb,
as the case was under investigation.


The blast occurred near the former headquarters of Thaksin's Thai
Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party.


Thaksin was ousted by the military in a September coup. He was in
New York when the army overthrew his twice-elected government and
has remained abroad since the putsch.


Last month a small bomb exploded in a telephone booth in front of
a Bangkok shopping centre, but did not cause any injuries.


Security was tightened around the capital after coordinated
blasts on New Year's Eve killed three and wounded more than 40.


Those attacks were followed by a coordinated arson and bombing
spree across insurgency-hit, mainly-Muslim southern provinces at
the start of the Lunar New Year in February.


The incidents left nine dead and 44 injured and were blamed on
Islamic separatists.
