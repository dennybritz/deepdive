Two small Turkish centre-right parties announced Saturday they
will merge ahead of July general elections in a bid to secure
seats in parliament.


The True Path party (DYP) and the Motherland party (ANAP) will
join together as the Democrat Party, said ANAP chief Erkan Mumcu.


In the last elections in 2002, neither of the two parties
succeeded in obtaining the 10 percent of the votes needed to hold
seats in parliament, and they have held merger discussions over
the past few weeks.


The government has called for July 22 general elections as a way
of resolving a dispute with secularists, including the army, over
the governing Justice and Development (AKP) party's backing of a
former Islamist to be Turkey's next president.
