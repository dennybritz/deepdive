South Africa's Andrew McLardy led the field at the rain-hit
Italian Open after Saturday's weather-interrupted second round.


With the weather in Milan playing havoc with the schedule here
this weekend organisers had little option but to shorten the
event to just three rounds leaving McLardy with a live chance of
capturing his first win on the European Tour.


McLardy moved to 14-under par with a second straight 65 to lead
England's Nick Dougherty, who carded a 64, by one shot.


In a three way tie for third were Spain's Alvaro Quiros, Austrian
Markus Brier, and Swede Joakim Backstrom, who followed up his
course record 62 on Thursday with a 70.


A win for McLardy, who was born in Zimbabwe to Scottish parents,
would be the perfect early celebration ahead of the birth of his
first child later this month.


He owed his position at the top of the leaderboard to birdies on
seven of the last 10 holes.


Further down the pack was Tom Lehman, last year's American Ryder
Cup captain, who added a 68 to his first round 70 to leave him
six under going into the final round.


Lehman's playing partner, last year's local winner, Francesco
Molinari, was on eight under.
