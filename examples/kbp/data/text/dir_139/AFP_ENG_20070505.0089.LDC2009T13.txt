The first voters went to the polls in France's presidential
election Saturday, as voting booths opened in the tiny French
island territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the Canadian
coast.


Some 5,000 people are registered to vote on the islands, which
have a population of just 6,300.


Voting takes place a day early in France's overseas territories
in the Americas, which also include the Caribbean islands of
Martinique and Guadeloupe and French Guyana in South America.


On the French mainland voting begins Sunday at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT),
with normally reliable projections due when polls close 12 hours
later.


Some 44 million voters are choosing between Socialist Segolene
Royal and the right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy, who is the clear
favourite.
