Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul insisted in an interview
Saturday that he would secure a majority if a popular vote was
held to decide who should be the country's president.


He was speaking after his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development
Party (AKP) moved Friday to push through a package of reforms
which would allow for the president to be elected by the nation,
not parliament.


Gul narrowly missed being elected president by lawmakers last
week.


The prospect of his taking the top job has prompted massive
demonstrations in Turkey, sparked by fears that the separation of
state and religion could be compromised if he was successful.


"Support for me is 70 percent (among the public)," Gul told the
Financial Times daily.


"That is why we have decided to go to the people. In the first
round, I will get the majority."


Asked if he intended to be his party's candidate in a direct
election, he replied: "Yes."


Gul added that Turkey's next president would be decided by
democratic vote, not a "higher council," and was critical of the
court which decided Tuesday to annul the first-round
parliamentary vote on the presidency.


"As the foreign minister, I respect and observe the court's
decision but that doesn't mean I am happy with it," he was quoted
as saying.


He referred to the crisis over the presidency, which prompted the
military to threaten to intervene and protect the country's
secular order, as a "shadow."


"Our responsibility is to remove this shadow and to put
everything on the right path," he added.
