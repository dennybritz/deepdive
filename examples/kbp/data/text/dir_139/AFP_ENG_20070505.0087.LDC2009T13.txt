One woman died and more than a dozen people were injured in a
roller coaster accident Saturday at a crowded Japanese theme
park, police and fire officials said.


Several passengers were thrown from the ride when it derailed and
crashed into a fence, said officials at the theme park in Osaka
prefecture.


The local fire department said one woman died and all 21
surviving passengers were taken to hospital for injuries and
observation following the accident, which occurred on a national
holiday.


Park officials later found parts of broken wheel shafts on the
ground.


"This fatal accident, a serious accident, occurred on Children's
Day, which should be a happy time for all. We have had no
accident for the past 35 years," said park president Saburo
Yamada.


"But we caused the fatal accident. As the man responsible for the
accident, I don't know what to say to apologise.


"I sincerely apologise to the public that we have caused them
such a trouble," he said.


A dozen people who witnessed the accident from the ground were
also taken to hospital feeling unwell, officials said.
