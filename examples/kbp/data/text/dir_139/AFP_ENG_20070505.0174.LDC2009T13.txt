Sierra Leone's presidential and legislative elections, slated for
July 28, have been postponed by two weeks, an electoral
commission official said Saturday.


The delay is due to the time between parliament's dissolution in
late June and the elections being "too short for us to organize a
free, fair and transparent election," said Curis Hooke, in charge
of communications for the National Electoral Commission.


He added that the polls would now be held on August 11 to give
lawmakers more time for the electoral campaign.


The elections are expected to serve as a crucial test of Sierra
Leone's democratic credentials and establish whether the country
is on the road to full recovery after a 10-year brutal civil war.


But for several weeks the main opposition parties have been
demanding they be postponed.


Victor Foh, secretary general of the main All People's Congress
opposition party, said that the delay was "all the fault of the
government."


"They had announced the date of the election without prior
consultations of the opposition parties. We are willing to go
along."


In response to opposition protests, the electoral commission had
organised meetings with the parties during the week before
deciding on the delay, Hooke said.


He added that both the opposition and the ruling Sierra Leone
People's Party had accepted the delay.
