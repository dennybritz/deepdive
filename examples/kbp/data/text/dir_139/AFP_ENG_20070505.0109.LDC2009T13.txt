A Chinese firm will help military-run Myanmar build seven hydro-
electric plants with combined power capacity likely to be the
biggest in the Southeast Asian country, state media said
Saturday.


The junta will team up with China Power Investment Corporation
(CPI), one of China's biggest power producers, to construct the
plants in northern Kachin state on the border with China, the
state-run daily New Light of Myanmar said.


"Upon completion, all projects are expected to generate 13,360
megawatts in total," the paper said without giving further
details.


It would surpass power capacity of 7,100 megawatts from Myanmar's
biggest hydro- power project between the junta and Thai energy
firm MDX Group.


The MDX project, worth six billion dollars, is expected to be
ready in 2012, with 85 percent of the electricity from the plant
going to Thailand, with the rest for Myanmar.


Myanmar, one of the world's poorest nations, is under a series of
US and European economic sanctions imposed over the junta's
rights abuses and the house arrest of 61-year-old democracy icon
and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.


But the impact of the sanctions has been weakened as Myanmar's
neighbours such as China, India and Thailand which are spending
billions of dollars for a share of its vast energy resources.


According to 2006 official figures, 13 foreign oil companies are
working on 33 projects in Myanmar, ruled by the military since
1962.
