Spanish police have arrested 13 people and another nine are under
suspicion in an operation against Internet child pornography,
officials said Saturday.


Millions of photos and videos as well as digital cameras and
computer equipment were seized during searches at the homes of
those arrested, the Civil Guards said.


The inquiry began after a Spanish Internet user in the southern
port city of Almeria said that a music file downloaded from the
Internet contained more than 150 photos of young naked girls,
probably minors.


Spanish police and the Civil Guards are conducting a concerted
fight against Internet pornography, aided by Hispalis, a computer
programme that provides the names and addresses of Internet users
accessing illegal child pornography sites.


On April 27, Spanish police said they had detained 11 people on
suspicion of downloading Internet pictures of a nine-year-old
girl sexually abused by an adult.
