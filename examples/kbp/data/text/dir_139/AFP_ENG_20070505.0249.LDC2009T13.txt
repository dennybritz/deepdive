An Austrian group declared on Saturday that it had set a record
for the world's longest restaurant table with place settings for
1,800.


The table, set up along a shopping street, stretched 1.2
kilometres (three- quarters of a mile), organisers said.


It actually included 600 tables, with 30 culture specialists
setting up 1,800 place settings with decorations. The total
weight was five tonnes.


Organisers said their table was long enough to beat the previous
Guinness world record of 1.036 kilometres set in the Austrian
city of Scharding last year.
