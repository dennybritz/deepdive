Gloucester trounced Saracens 50-9 to book their place in next
weekend's Premiership final at Twickenham.


Gloucester, aiming for their first Premeirship title, will face
Leicester, who won their semi-final play-off against Bristol
26-14.


After finishing top of the league after the 22-game season,
Gloucester moved to within one victory of the title with seven
unanswered tries for their highest margin win of the campaign.


The touchdowns came from Peter Richards, Luke Narraway, Anthony
Allen, Andy Hazell, Mark Foster and Christian Califano.


Beaten finlaists in 2005 and 2006 Leicester made sure of their
third consecutive final appearance to hand outgoing coach Pat
Howard a perfect parting gift in his last game in charge at
Welford Road.


Howard, who is heading back to Australia, watched as his side
scored a brace of tries from Harry Ellis and Geordan Murphy with
the remaining 16 points coming from the boot of Andy Goode.
