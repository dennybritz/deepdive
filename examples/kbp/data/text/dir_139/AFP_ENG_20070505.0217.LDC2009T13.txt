Police in Spain have arrested 13 people across the country as
part of an operation against Internet child pornography,
officials said Saturday.


Another nine people have been detained for questioning as part of
the probe but have not yet been charged with any crimes, the
Civil Guard said.


Millions of photos and videos as well as digital cameras and
computer equipment were seized during searches at the homes of
those arrested, officials said in a statement.


One of the 13 people detained, a 24-year-old man in the southern
city of Cordoba, alone had more than half a million photgraphs
and 7,000 pornagraphic videos.


Police said some of the suspects used computers belonging to
family members to download pornographic images without their
knowledge.


One suspect allegedly used a computer belonging to his
grandparents without them being aware of it, police said.


The inquiry began in March 2006 after a Spanish Internet user in
the southern port city of Almeria said that a music file
downloaded from the Internet contained more than 150 photos of
young naked girls, probably minors.


Spanish police and the Civil Guards are conducting a concerted
fight against Internet pornography, aided by Hispalis, a computer
programme that provides the names and addresses of Internet users
accessing illegal child pornography sites.


On April 27, Spanish police said they had detained 11 people on
suspicion of downloading Internet pictures of a nine-year-old
girl sexually abused by an adult.
