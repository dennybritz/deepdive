Faulty equipment was suspected in the death of eight people in
two weeks in a hospital in southern Italy, local authorities were
quoted as saying Saturday.


Puglia regional government health chief Alberto Tedesco said that
at least one patient, a 73-year-old woman who died Friday, had
been found to have inhaled anaesthetic instead of oxygen because
of a defective connection.


The deaths all occurred in the cardiac intensive care unit of the
hospital at Castellaneta.


The Italian health ministry and judicial authorities have
launched inquiries.
