China suspended diplomatic relations with St Lucia on Saturday
and protested the Caribbean state's resumption of ties with
Taiwan, state media reported.


Foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said the resumption of
ties was a "flagrant violation" of a 1997 declaration
establishing ties between China and St. Lucia, Xinhua news agency
said.


Taiwan and St Lucia signed a communique establishing ties on
April 30, drawing an angry statement from Liu accusing Taiwan of
"interference in the internal affairs of China."


St Lucia, an island nation in the eastern Caribbean with a
population of about 170,000, opened diplomatic relations with
Taiwan in 1984, when current Prime Minister John Compton was
first in power.


Taipei severed ties in 1997, when then prime minister Kenny
Anthony switched recognition to Beijing. Compton was re-elected
late last year.


Including St Lucia, 25 countries now recognise Taipei. Latin
America, the South Pacific and Africa are the main diplomatic
battlegrounds for rivals Taiwan and China, which split in 1949 at
the end of a civil war.


Taiwan and China have each accused each other in the past of
using "chequebook diplomacy" to lure the other's allies.


Taipei suffered a diplomatic setback when Chad switched
recognition to Beijing last year.
