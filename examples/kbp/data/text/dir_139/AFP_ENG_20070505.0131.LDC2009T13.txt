Dozens of people were injured and possibly one killed overnight
in a small town in Kansas when it was hit by a massive tornado,
local media reports said Saturday.


The twister that struck Greensburg without warning has destroyed
more than half the buildings in the town located in a
southwestern part of the state, the reports said.


Rescue crew were searching the rubble for survivors.
