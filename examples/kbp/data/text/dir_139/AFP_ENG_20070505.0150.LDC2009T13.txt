A massive tornado collapsed a hospital and wiped out up to 90
percent of a small town in southern Kansas, local officials and
US media said Saturday.


At least one person died and around 60 people were injured as the
storm blasted through Greensburg, Kansas, according to Wichita
television station KAKE citing the head of Western Plains Medical
Complex in nearby Dodge City.


Reports said about 75 percent of local homes and buildings were
wrecked in Greensburg, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) west of
Wichita.


Andrea Anglin of the American Red Cross told CNN that about 90
percent of the town of some 1,600 people was damaged or
destroyed.


According to reports some 30 people were pulled from the rubble
of the local hospital as the storm tore homes from their
foundations and even damaged below- ground shelters.


"It sucked the door off of our storm shelter," Kevin Hillhouse
told KAKE.


With all utilities down, Greensburg is being evacuated, Anglin
said early Saturday.


"We already have about 400 people in our shelter," Anglin said.


The massive tornado, filmed by self-styled "storm chasers,"
struck at about 10:00 pm (0300 GMT).


National weather reports put the tornado at between F3 (severe)
and F4 (devastating) on a F0 to F5 scale. An F4 storm carries
winds of from 331-416 kilometers (207-260 miles) per hour.


"We are definitely thinking a mile wide" Darin Brunin, one of the
storm chasers told CNN about the extraordinary size of the storm.
