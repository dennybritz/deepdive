Biarritz's 22-13 victory over French championship leaders Stade
Francais on Saturday gave them a boost in their hopes of gaining
a semi-final spot.


Biarritz and Perpignan, who won 31-18 against Agen on Friday,
with an offensive bonus point, are in fourth and fifth spots and
level on 70 points with two games to go till the end of the
regular season.


Biarritz however are in a better position to gain the final semi-
final spot as they have won both matches between the sides which
will come into play if they finish level on points.


Biarritz also have a better fixture run-in, having to play at
13th-placed Montpellier and hosting Castres, while Perpignan must
play at league leaders Stade Francais before hosting Montpellier.


Biarritz joint-coach Patrice Lagisquet said: "For our next match
at Montpellier we will have a very different strategy and we will
need to be solid to win. But we are getting more and more
confident of reaching the semi-finals."
