Iranian intelligence officials are holding a former nuclear
negotiator from the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami, the
Tehran prosecutor confirmed on Saturday.


"The intelligence ministry is in charge of investigating
accusations against Hossein Moussavian," the official IRNA news
agency quoted Saeed Mortazavi as saying.


He confirmed that Moussavian was in custody but refused to
specify the allegations against him "until the investigations are
complete."


Moussavian, part of a moderate negotiating team that served until
2005, was arrested at his home in Tehran on Monday.


The semi-official Fars news agency said on Wednesday that
Moussavian "was arrested and detained for a series of links with
foreigners and exchanging information with them."


Quoting unnamed sources it said "Moussavian had probably
exchanged information with foreigners over nuclear issues and he
could face espionage charges."


He played a central role in talks that saw Iran strike a deal
with Europe under which it suspended its controversial uranium
enrichment activities, a freeze which was reversed when President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power.


The nuclear negotiating team under Khatami was considered close
to the centrist cleric and former president Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who was thrashed by Ahmadinejad in 2005 presidential
elections.
