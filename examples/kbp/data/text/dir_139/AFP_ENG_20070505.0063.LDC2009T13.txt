China's Abudusataer Wujiabudula on Saturday won what is billed as
the world's first high wire championship, organisers of the
unusual stunt said.


Wujiabudula, an ethnic Uighur, took 11 minutes 22.49 seconds to
walk a one- kilometre (3,300-foot)-long and three-centimetre
(1.2-inch) thick wire strung across the Han River in the South
Korean capital.


Alan Martinez from Colombia, who has walked over the Amazon, came
next, completing the race in 11:30.54.


Jade Kinder Martin, who crossed the River Thames on a high wire,
took third place with a time of 11:35.54.


China's Adili Wuxiuer, who became famous by walking a rope
stretched 662 metres across Chongqing cliff in 2003, at a height
of 687 metres, only managed fourth place in 11:53.93.


Organisers said anyone who made it across the Han on the high
wire, suspended 21 metres (70 feet) above the surface, would
break the distance record.


The Seoul city government offered the winner a cash prize of
15,000 dollars, with the runner-up and third placed getting
10,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively.


Eighteen skywalkers from nine countries were invited to take part
in the stunt, part of the city's festival dubbed "Hi Seoul."
