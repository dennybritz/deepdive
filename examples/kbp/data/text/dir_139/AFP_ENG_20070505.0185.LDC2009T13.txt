Cockney Rebel, named after English rock legend Steve Harley's
1970s band, landed the English 2000 Guineas here on Saturday at
the outlandish odds of 25/1.


The three-year-old colt claimed trainer Geoff Huffer and owner
Phil Cunningham's first classic having been brought with an
inspired run by French jockey Olivier Peslier.


He easily saw off longtime leader Vital Equine (33/1) while Dutch
Art - trained by former Guineas winning handler Peter Chapple-
Hyam (14/1) - was third and Irish raider Duke of Marmalade (14/1)
was fourth.


"This is as exciting as it happens," said 55-year-old Harley, who
was asked by Cunningham if he could name the horse after his
band.


"I've lived a life that is for sure but this is something
special.


"Personally I have been involved with handicap hurdlers so this
is a new frontier in a way for me," added Harley, who had one
number one with Make Me Smile in 1975.


Peslier - whose four legged compatriot US Ranger looked at one
point set to deliver trainer Jean-Claude Rouget's first ever
classic and France's fifth winner in 22 years - said he thought
that perhaps he had come too soon when he overhauled Vital
Equine.


"I thought maybe I have come too soon," said Peslier, whose star
has waned somewhat in the light of Belgian-born arch rival
Christophe Soumillon's rise.


"However he is very relaxed this horse and he ran a really good
race and delivered me my first Guineas."
