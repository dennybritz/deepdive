Armed men kidnapped a Briton from an oil rig in southern Nigeria,
industry and diplomatic sources said Saturday.


"We can confirm a British national was kidnapped overnight in the
Niger Delta," a diplomat told AFP, adding that he could not
release further details.


"A group attacked Trident 8," said Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for
Transocean Inc., referring to a Transocean rig drilling for
Conoil off Brass, in the southern Bayelsa state.


Cantwell confirmed that one the company's subcontractors was
seized but said the company would not speculate on the identity
of the attackers.


"Another 23 people are on the rig and are safe. The rig is also
safe," he told AFP from Transocean's Houston, Texas headquarters.


A support vessel backing up Trident 8 came under attack two weeks
ago in an incident where three Nigerian staff were kidnapped and
six people injured, security sources said.


After a temporary lull in the kidnapping of foreigners during
elections in April, such attacks are once again on the rise.


In the past week alone, six foreigners were seized Tuesday by the
most high- profile militant group operating in the region, the
Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta.


On Thursday a total of 20 foreigners were seized by different
armed groups but eight were later released the same day.
