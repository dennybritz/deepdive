At least four people were killed after a massive tornado
collapsed a hospital and wrecked up to 90 percent of a small town
in southern Kansas, local officials and US media said Saturday.


Four died in the area and around 60 people were injured as the
storm made a direct hit on Greensburg, Kansas, Sharon Watson,
spokeswoman for Kansas Emergency Management, told CNN.


According to reports some 30 people were pulled from the rubble
of Kiowa County Memorial Hospital as the storm ripped homes off
their foundations and even damaged below-ground shelters.


The US National Weather Center meanwhile warned of more severe
weather in the US midwest Saturday, spawning possibly new severe
tornadoes.


Reports said about 75 percent of local homes and buildings were
destroyed  in Greensburg, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) west
of Wichita.


Andrea Anglin of the American Red Cross told CNN that about 90
percent of the town of some 1,600 people was damaged.


"It sucked the door off of our storm shelter," Kevin Hillhouse
told Wichita television KAKE.


Television images showed the town virtually levelled, with leaves
and branches sheared off trees and schoolbuildings wrecked.


With all utilities down, Greensburg is being evacuated, Anglin
said early Saturday.


"We already have about 400 people in our shelter," she said.


The massive wedge-shaped tornado, caught on film by self-styled
"storm chasers," struck at about 10:00 pm (0300 GMT Saturday).


National weather reports put the tornado at between F3 (severe)
and F4 (devastating) on a F0 to F5 scale. An F4 storm carries
winds of 331-416 kilometers (207-260 miles) per hour.


"We are definitely thinking a mile wide" Darin Brunin, one of the
storm chasers told CNN about the extraordinary size of the storm.
