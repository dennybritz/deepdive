Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso has reiterated Japan's
readiness to restart the stalled six-way talks on North Korea's
nuclear crisis, Kyodo News said Saturday.


Aso said the talks might resume as early as next week if the
issue of North Korean funds frozen in a Macau bank was resolved,
Kyodo said.


He made the remark to reporters after meeting with South Korean
Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon in Egypt on the sidelines of a
conference on Iraq, Kyodo said in a dispatch from the conference.


Under a February 13 deal, North Korea was given 60 days to shut
down its Yongbyon plant and allow international inspectors back
into the country in exchange for energy aid.


North Korea has refused to take steps to shut down the reactor
because its 25 million dollars in funds remained frozen as a
result of US action in the bank.


US envoy Christopher Hill said in Washington Friday he was
hopeful the funds would be freed up soon. The process was said to
have been held up by "technical issues."


Hill said North Korea could shut down and disable the nuclear
plant by the end of this year.


The six-way talks group the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia, and
the United States.
