Canadian auto-parts maker Magna International remains the only
serious candidate to buy Chrysler, the loss-making US unit of
German-US car giant DaimlerChrysler, and a deal should be done
this month, a specialist weekly said Saturday.


Quoting sources close to the negotiations, Automobilwoche said
DaimlerChrysler was still talking to other possibles, including
investment funds Blackstone and Cerberus, but solely for tactical
reasons.


The sources said Magna would probably only keep Chrysler for a
limited time, selling the firm on after restructuring.


They said the Canadian firm was likely to set up a separate
holding for Chrysler to prevent any of its own clients such as
General Motors or BMW leaving because of a clash of interests.


Chrysler is Magna's biggest customer.


Last month the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily said Magna
was teaming up with Canadian investment group Onex for a joint
bid for the majority stake in Chrysler, while Daimler would hold
on to a smaller stake.


Magna was willing to pay a similar amount for Chrysler as US
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, whose investment vehicle Tracinda
placed an offer of 4.5 billion dollars (3.3 billion euros) on the
table, the newspaper added.
