Two military helicopters and police searched Saturday for sign of
a Kenya Airways airliner believed to have crashed in dense forest
in southern Cameroon, radio reports said.


The search focused on a region around the town of Lolodorf, some
100 kilometres (60 miles) southwest of the capital Yaounde, where
witnesses said they heard a loud explosion overnight, Cameroon
Radio and Television (CRTV) reported.


Officials in Nairobi said the plane, a Boeing 737-800, was
carrying 114 people.


It had taken off from Douala airport in western Cameroon in a
violent storm after midnight, headed for Nairobi.


In his last radio message to air traffic controllers, the pilot
"simply confirmed that the plane had taken off," a source close
to the Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in Africa
(ASECNA) said.


Shortly afterwards the aircraft disappeared from radar screens.


A satellite picked up a distress signal from the plane at 2:00 am
(0100 GMT), nearly two hours after it had taken off, the source
said.


The regional administrator for the area had set up a base in
Lolodorf to coordinate the search, that was involving all the
police in the zone, the state broadcaster said.


But an administration source said nothing had yet been found.


"The searches are very difficult because they are taking place in
an area of very dense forest."
