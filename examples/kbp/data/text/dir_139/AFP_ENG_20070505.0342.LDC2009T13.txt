St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Chris Carpenter, a two-time All-Star
and winner of the 2005 National League Cy Young award, will have
elbow surgery and miss at least three months, the team said
Saturday.


Carpenter, 32, has been sidelined with arthritis in his elbow
since April 9. The righthander had been progressing towards his
return to the team, throwing three simulated innings on Tuesday.


However, Carpenter later developed stiffness and was found to
have recurrent swelling and loss of motion after being examined
by team physician George Paletta.


Carpenter, who went 15-8 with a 3.09 ERA in 32 starts for the
World Series- winning Cardinals last year, is expected to have
surgery early next week.


He has made just one start this year, giving up five runs and
nine hits in six innings of a season-opening 6-1 loss to the New
York Mets on April 1.


The Cardinals have lost five of their last six games, a span in
which hey were out-scored 38-10.
