A 50-year-old female spectator was killed during the Rally of
Argentina on Saturday when an amateur driver hit a group of three
people, race organisers announced.


Argentina's Gonzalo Alenaz lost control of his Subaru as he was
approaching the start of the 11km 14th special stage between
Cosquin and Tanti.


The fatal accident left a 30-year-old man with an injured
shoulder and a 25 -year-old woman with an injured ankle.


Thousands of spectators had been watching the race during
Saturday's second day when France's reigning three-time world
champion Sebastien Loeb led after winning the first five specials
of the day.


Loeb's Citroen was 15 seconds ahead of the Ford Focus of
Finland's Marcus Gronholm and 25 seconds in front of the Subaru
of Norway's Petter Solberg after the 75km of timed sections.


Finland's Mikko Hirvonen was fourth, 41sec behind Loeb. "I felt
good today," said Loeb before taking on the final four specials
of the afternoon.


A gap has opened up behind the leading four with the Citroen of
Spain's Dani Sordo in fifth spot, 1min 20sec behind Loeb.
