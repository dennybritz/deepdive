The daughter of ousted Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev has been
charged in connection with disturbances in court and subjected to
travel and other restrictions, her lawyers said on Saturday.


Bermet Akayeva has been charged with obstructing justice,
damaging or stealing court documents and showing disrespect to a
judge following disturbances on April 24, a member of her legal
team, Ikramidin Aitkulov, told journalists.


She could be jailed for up to two years if found guilty and is
not allowed to leave her home at night or leave the capital, her
lawyers said.


The charges relate to a court hearing in the northern Kemin
district in which Akayeva was stripped of the right to stand for
election.


Regional prosecutor Dzhumadyl Makeshov said she had been
questioned over her "immediate presence" at the hearing, at which
a judge was beaten and windows and doors smashed.


Akayeva has continued to play a role in political life in this
Central Asian country since she stood for parliament at elections
in 2005 that were heavily criticized by Western observers and led
to mass unrest and Akayev's ouster.


She fled the country along with her father and other relatives
but later returned.


Akayeva was deprived of the right to stand for election on the
basis that she had not been continuously resident in the country
for five years.


Opponents accuse the family of illegally profiting from their
time in power while Akayev has alleged that what took place was
an illegal coup.
