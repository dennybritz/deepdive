Germany's finance minister expects 90 billion euros more in tax
revenue over 2008-2011 than previously projected, which he hopes
will help balance the budget in several years, according to an
interview.


Peer Steinbruck, speaking to Welt am Sonntag, said however that
the government will also have to deal with "at least 50 billion
euros" (68 billion dollars) in new spending in the coming years.


That includes 19 billion euros (26 billion dollars) for health
insurance and 12 billion for business tax reform, he said.


Steinbruck called reaching a balanced budget "desirable" as
Europe's largest economy continues to rebound.


Der Spiegel magazine reports in its issue to appear Monday that
the first balanced budget since 1969 could be achieved in 2011.


New government forecasts for tax receipts are due to be published
in the coming week.
