Three people were killed and about a dozen more were feared dead
in an explosion at a chemical factory in western India, police
said on Saturday.


"We found three bodies. We are still looking for about 13 or 14
people. Sadly, it is highly unlikely that we will find
survivors," Nikhil Gupta, police superintendent of Nashik town,
told AFP by phone.


Five workers were taken to hospital after the three-storey
facility collapsed late Friday in western Maharashtra state.


The factory produced explosives for the construction industry.


The cause of the explosion was not known.
