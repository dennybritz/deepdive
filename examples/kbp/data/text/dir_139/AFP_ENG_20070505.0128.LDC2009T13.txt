A Saudi man was beheaded by the sword on Saturday after being
convicted of murdering a youth who refused to have sexual
intercourse with him, interior ministry said.


Ibn al-Zein bin Ibrahim bin Houfan al-Assiri was found guilty of
stabbing to death a Yemeni boy, Ali bin Mohammed Hasni, the
ministry said in a statement carried by SPA state news agency.


It said that the two were drinking alcohol before Assiri
attempted to sodomise the youth.


He was executed in the southwestern town of Abha.


The latest beheading brings to 54 the number of executions
announced by the Saudi government so far this year.


For the whole of 2006, at least 37 people were executed, while 83
were put to death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to
AFP tallies based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public in Saudi Arabia,
which applies a strict form of sharia, or Islamic law. Rape,
murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can all
carry the death penalty.
