American Chris Horner pulled on the race leader's jersey
following the fourth and penultimate stage of the Tour of
Romandie won by Spain's Igor Anton here Saturday.


Anton, who rides for the Basque outfit Euskaltel, claimed the
stage honours after 155.9km of climbing between Charmey and
Morgins.


Horner, of Predictor-Lotto, finished third on the stage after
Anton sprinted ahead of a four-man group to beat Dutch ace Thomas
Dekker, of Rabobank, Horner and promising Frenchman John Gadret
of AG2r.


Sunday's final stage is a testing 20.4km time trial around
Lausanne which Horner's team-mate Cadel Evans - the Australian
who is the defending champion - will be targeting after his fifth
place finish Saturday.


Evans, who finished fifth overall on the Tour de France last
year, won the Tour of Romandie in 2006 thanks to a decisive time
trial however he could be hard pushed by a handful of fellow
contenders.


Horner currently leads Anton by 17sec, with Dekker in third
overall at 09 and Italian Paolo Savoldelli, eighth on the stage
at 16secs behind Anton, in fourth at 15.


Evans, an ace climber who is also a strong time trialler, has
29secs to make up on Horner but will also have to pedal faster
than the likes of Dekker, Savoldelli and Kazakh ace Andriy
Kashechkin, who is ninth at 31secs, if he is to have any chance
of victory.
