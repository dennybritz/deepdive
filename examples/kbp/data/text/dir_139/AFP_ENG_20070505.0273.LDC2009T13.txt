More than 3,000 police will be deployed in Paris and its suburbs
to head off the threat of violence after Sunday's presidential
election in France, police officials said Saturday.


Railway stations will be under high surveillance in case gangs of
youths travel to the capital to disrupt victory festivities.


"There are no advance signs and we have no special information,
but we are keeping a close watch on the suburbs, and we've also
got our eye on the radical movements of the far-left," an
official said on condition of anonymity.


There are fears that a victory for right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy
could spark unrest in the poor high-immigration neighbourhoods
that were the scene of riots in 2005.


Sarkozy, who was interior minister at the time, is a hate figure
for many young people of black and Arab origin. He has also been
vilified as a hard-right authoritarian by many on the left.


On Friday Sarkozy's opponent Socialist Segolene Royal warned of
"violence and brutalities that will be triggered across the
country" if he wins.


Sarkozy, 52, who heads the ruling Union for a Popular Movement
(UMP), is seen as the clear favourite in Sunday's election.


Aides said there will be a celebration in the Place de la
Concorde in central Paris if Sarkozy wins.


In addition to riot police, thousands of regular police men and
women and plain- clothes officers will be on patrol.
