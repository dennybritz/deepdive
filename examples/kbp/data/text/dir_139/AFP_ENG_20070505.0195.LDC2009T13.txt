English football's Premier League is to sue the YouTube video
clip sharing website for alleged copyright infringement, the BBC
online reported on Saturday.


The league's lawsuit said that YouTube, which is owned by Google,
had "knowingly misappropriated and exploited this valuable
property" by encouraging footage to be viewed on its site, the
BBC said.


Last October, the Premier League wrote to YouTube, asking it to
take down online material which it said infringed the legal
rights of its partners and clubs.


At the time, a spokesman said that they did not expect to take
legal action. But according to the BBC, the Premier League has
now launched a case in New York and is claiming unspecified
damages.


In March, US media giant Viacom launched a billion dollar (736
million euro) lawsuit against YouTube, accusing it of illegally
showing clips from its television shows.


YouTube denies these claims, the BBC reported.
