A football match between Muslim and Christian clergy aimed at
bringing together the two religions was cancelled on Saturday
after the imams refused to play against women, the organisers
said.


"For the past two days, everything seemed to be going fine and
then the Muslims finally decided it would be impossible to play
against female ministers and risk physical contact," Olav Fykse
Tveyt, one of the leaders of the Norwegian Protestant church,
told AFP.


The match was planned as part of a religious conference in Oslo
entitled "Shoulder to Shoulder."


According to the Norwegian press agency NTB, the church tried to
resolve the issue by asking its female ministers to play in
trousers and baggy tops.


When that failed, it said they should not play at all, but this
provoked outrage from the women and the team captain resigned.


"Not everything is negative," said Fykse Tveyt. "Both sides have
learned to better understand our cultures and we have had an open
discussion."
