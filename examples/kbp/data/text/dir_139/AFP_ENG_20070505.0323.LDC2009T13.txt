Romania's suspended president campaigned on Saturday for his
political future in Spain, home to the large Romanian diaspora in
the world, two weeks before a referendum on his impeachment.


Speaking before a crowd of roughly 1,000 Romanians in Madrid
ahead of the May 19 plebiscite, Traian Basescu denounced the
"political-financial oligarchy" that he says rules his country.


"I have come to support the president's fight against
corruption," Vasilachi Lonel, a Romanian who has lived in Spain
for three years, told AFP.


Basescu, who was suspended by parliament last month for allegedly
violating the constitution, was also scheduled to speak later on
Saturday in Castile in eastern Spain which has a large Romanian
population.


Some one million Romanians live in Spain making it the biggest
Romanian immigrant community in the world, according to Adere, a
group which represents their interests in the country.


During the 2004 presidential election in Romania, over 70 percent
of Romanians living abroad voted for Basescu.


More than half of Romania's 17.9 registered voters must vote in
favour of suspending Basescu for him to be removed from office.


Some observers doubt that the turnout will be sufficient,
especially considering that some two million Romanians work
abroad.


Basescu, 55, who remains a popular political figure in Romania,
has said he would quit politics if he lost the vote. If he wins,
Basescu has promised to continue to fight corruption and clean up
the political class.
