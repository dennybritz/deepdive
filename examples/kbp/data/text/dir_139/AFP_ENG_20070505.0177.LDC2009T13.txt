Dutch Princess Ariane, the one-month old daughter of Crown Prince
Willem- Alexander, has returned home from hospital after being
treated for bronchitis, the royal house announced on Saturday.


The newborn princess was admitted on Wednesday with respiratory
problems, and the royal information service (RVD) said she was
still on antibiotics.


Bronchitis often affects babies but can be serious for those aged
under three months.


Princess Ariane, who was born on April 10, is the granddaughter
of Dutch Queen Beatrix and is fourth in line for the throne
behind her father and two sisters.
