Former Australian and US Open junior champion Viktoria Azarenka
will face off in her first WTA-level final on Sunday against a
German 11 years her senior at the Estoril Open.


Belarus-born Azarenka, 17, who trains in the desert heat of
Scottsdale, upset third-seeded former champion Lucie Safarova
6-4, 6-0.


The Czech won the title in 2005.


German Greta Arn, ranked 176th to the 68th of Azarenka, booked
her place in the title match over Spain's Nuria Llagostera Vives
7-6 (7/0), 6-2.


Azarenka broke the ineffective Safarova on all five of her
chances, to seal the win in just 67 minutes, losing her own serve
once.


"I'm in a dream, this is fantasy," said the excited winner, who
has shown form this season with third-round placings at the
Australian Open, Indian


Wells and Miami.


"I'm enjoying this a lot. I didn't play so well on clay last
season, but I've improved my game a lot now."


The finalists have never met.


In men's semi-finals at the Estadio Nacional, third seed Novak
Djokovic was taking on number two Tommy Robredo of Spain while
French friends Richard Gasquet and Paul-Henri Mathieu were set
for a clash.
