Belgian first seed Justine Henin outlasted Serbia's Jelena
Jankovic 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 to reach the final of the WTA tournament
here on Saturday.


Henin made a flying start and held a point for a 5-0 lead before
the fourth seeded Serb found her feet and began to offer a
challenge.


As Henin's aggression level slipped a little, Jankovic began to
dictate more of the rallies and often forced the Belgian into
errors as she levelled at 4-4.


After breaking in the final game of the first set Henin held two
points to break for 2-0 in the second, but Jankovic held off the
threat and instead broke Henin to lead 2-1.


A further break at 4-2 left her serving for the set, and took the
match into a tense decider.


Henin once more took the upper hand, breaking to lead 3-1, but
Jankovic forced a forehand error from Henin to break break back
in the next game.


With the match evenly balanced, Henin failed to win a break point
at 4-3, but Jankovic then sent a forehand long on break point at
5-4 to concede the two hour 35-minute battle.


Despite her defeat, Jankovic will achieve a career-high ranking
of six on Monday.
