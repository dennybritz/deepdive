Cameroonian authorities said late Saturday they have called off
until daybreak their search for a missing Kenyan airline with 114
people on board feared crashed in dense forest.


Throughout the day helicopters and aircraft from the military
searched a vast area of forest in southern Cameroon where it is
feared the six month-old Boeing 737 crashed in the early hours of
Saturday in treacherous weather conditions.


From midday onwards the search focused on a region around the
town of Lolodorf, 100 kilometres (60 miles) southwest of Yaounde,
where witnesses said they heard a loud explosion overnight,
Cameroon state radio and TV said.


Officials from Kenya Airways, which has not yet confirmed that
its aircraft has crashed, said that poor weather was hampering
the search.


Officials in Nairobi said the plane had taken off from Douala
airport in western Cameroon in a violent storm after midnight,
headed for Nairobi.


In his last radio message to air traffic controllers, the pilot
"simply confirmed that the plane had taken off," a source close
to the Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in Africa
(ASECNA) said.


Shortly afterwards the aircraft disappeared from radar screens.


A satellite picked up a distress signal from the plane at 2:00 am
(0100 GMT), nearly two hours after it had taken off, the source
said.
