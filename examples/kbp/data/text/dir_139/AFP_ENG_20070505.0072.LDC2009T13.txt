Ukrainian rider Yaroslav Popovych will lead the challenge for the
elite cycling team Discovery Channel for the Tour of Italy in the
absence of last year's champion Ivan Basso.


The 27-year-old heads up a team of great experience - 58 major
Tours between them - with a view to winning at least one stage
and to wear the overall leader's pink jersey at some point during
the race which runs from May 12 to June 3.


Popovych - third in the Tour of Italy in 2003 - replaces Basso
after the Italian quit the team last Monday claiming that ongoing
suspicions on him were damaging the team.


The 29-year-old Basso was one of dozens of riders implicated in
the 'Operation Puerto' doping affair last year, which has re-
erupted in recent weeks.


Basso has always protested his innocence.


"The departure of Basso from our team is of course a real loss,"
said the team's sporting director Sean Yates.


Team:


Yaroslav Popovych, Volodymyr Bileka (both UKR), Steve Cummings
(GBR), Pavel Padrnos (CZE), Jose Luis Rubiera (ESP), Tomas
Vaitkus (LTU), Brian Vandborg (DEN), Jurgen Van Goolen (BEL),
Matthew White (AUS).
