Chinese star hurdler Liu Xiang continued his perfect winning
record at the Japan Grand Prix on Saturday in his rehearsal for
the world championships later this year.


The Athens Olympic gold medallist, the winner here in the past
three years, clocked 13.14 seconds in the 110m hurdles in his
first outdoor race of the season.


Teammate Shi Dongpeng, who lost to Liu in the Asian Games in Doha
in December, came second in a personal best of 13.24, followed by
Japan's Tasuku Tanonaka third in 13.59.


Asian Games bronze medallist Masato Naito was fourth in 13.60.


"I'm very satisfied with the time in my first outdoor race of the
season. Further more, Shi Dongpeng set his personal best. I'm
really happy about it. We both want to finish in the top eight in
the world championships," said Liu.


The world championships, the last major athletics event before
the Beijing Olympics in 2008, will be held at the same stadium
here in August.


"I didn't do special training for this race, because there were
not big rivals, so I was quite sure that I would win if I could
run my usual race. I set a personal best of 7.42 (indoors) in
Germany this season, so I'm quite confident," he said, referring
to his result in the indoor 60m hurdles.


"This race is a preparation race for the world championships in
August and my biggest goal of the year is to win the gold medal,"
added the 23-year-old world record holder.
