Canada's ruling Conservatives, in crisis over climate change and
tainted by reports of torture in Afghanistan, have slipped in
support to the same level as their Liberal rivals, a poll showed
Saturday.


The Ipsos-Reid poll for the Canwest media group showed 35 percent
of people would vote for the Conservatives of Prime Minister
Stephen Harper, against 34 percent for the main opposition
Liberals.


"It's been a bad couple of weeks" for the government led by
Harper's right-wing minority, said the polling institute's
president Darrell Bricker.


"This was always a government with training wheels and the wheels
are wobbling."


The government has been in crisis for two weeks over allegations
by Afghan authorities that prisoners captured by Canadian forces
involved in NATO-led operations in Afghanistan were tortured by
their Afghan jailers.


Opposition critics and ecologists have closed in on another
front, branding Harper's efforts to combat climate change
insufficient.


The latest poll represents a slump in support for the
Conservatives, down from 39 percent in a previous survey.
