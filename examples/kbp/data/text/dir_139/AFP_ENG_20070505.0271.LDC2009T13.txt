The government of Oman has withdrawn from Bahrain-based Gulf Air,
leaving the Bahraini government the sole owner of the troubled
airline, it was announced on Saturday.


The official BNA news agency and Oman's ONA news agency both
reported that Muscat's decision to pull out was communicated in
writing to Manama on Saturday.


Founded in 1974, Gulf Air was owned equally by the governments of
Bahrain and Oman, after Qatar and Abu Dhabi withdrew in 2002 and
2005 respectively.


Its chief executive Andre Dose said last month that the carrier
was losing more than a million dollars a day, and unveiled a plan
to cut its fleet and jobs.
