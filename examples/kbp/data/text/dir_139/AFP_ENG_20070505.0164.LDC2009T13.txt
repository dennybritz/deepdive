Ten army recruits were killed and 13 wounded on Saturday when a
suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest at their recruitment
centre west of Baghdad, a security official said.


The recruits were from the largely rural tribal area not far from
Abu Ghraib, and part of an effort to get Sunni tribesmen into the
security forces to combat Iraq's insurgency, a Fallujah police
officer told AFP.


Insurgents frequently target recruiting centres for Iraq's
fledgling police and army.
