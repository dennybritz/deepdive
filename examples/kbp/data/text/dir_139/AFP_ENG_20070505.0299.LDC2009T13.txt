Two deputy ministers in Bulgaria's centre-left government were
dismissed Saturday while Economy and Energy Minister Rumen
Ovcharov was told to take leave.


All three are implicated in a corruption investigation that is
the first in Bulgaria to involve high-ranking government
officials.


Ovcharov offered to resign but following talks with Prime
Minister Sergey Stanishev Saturday, he was told to take sick
leave, the government information service said in a statement.


Ovcharov's deputy Kormelia Ninova, and the deputy minister of
disaster management Delyan Peevski were named as the other
dismissed officials Saturday.


Bulgaria joined the European Union in January but is being
watched closely by the European Commission, the EU's executive
arm because of its slow paced reforms of the judiciary and the
failure to curb crime and corruption.
