Public celebrations will be held on the Place de la Concorde in
central Paris if right-wing favourite Nicolas Sarkozy wins the
presidential election Sunday, an aide to the candidate said
Saturday.


French rock-star Johnny Hallyday and other show business
supporters of Sarkozy will perform at what was described as a
"great people's party".


The Place de la Concorde is a vast esplanade beside the river
Seine at the end of the Champs-Elysees. It was famously the spot
where King Louis XVI and hundreds of others were executed in the
Revolution.
