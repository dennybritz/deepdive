John Higgins produced a stirring comeback against fellow Scot
Stephen Maguire to book a place in the final of the World Snooker
Championship on Saturday.


Trailing 14-10 going into the final session at The Crucible in
Sheffield, former champion Higgins produced some scintillating
break-building to win the best of 33 semi-final 17-15.


Higgins, who beat Ronnie O'Sullivan on his way to the semi-final,
compiled a high break of 133 but missed out on the opportunity of
a 147 maximum, ending up with 104.


Higgins revealed to the BBC how gruelling the match had been. He
said: "I'll be honest, it was absolutely mad out there,
especially in the last frame. But I'm just so delighted to win.


"I've never fought so hard to come through a match in my life. I
was just hanging onto Stephen's coat-tails for most of the match
because he was playing so well, making unbelievable pots."


The Scot also revealed his techniques for dealing with pressure
situations. He said: "I never thought, even at 14-10 down, that I
was out of it and I've been working on my positive thinking and
relaxation exercises to deal with situations like this."


Higgins will face either Mark Selby or former winner Shaun Murphy
in the final. Their match is locked at 12-12.
