Suspected Sunni militants Saturday killed a man from the minority
Shiite community in a remote Pakistani town which had been under
curfew following series of sectarian killings, police said.


Two masked men on a bicycle shot the victim on the outskirts of
Dera Ismail Khan town and fled, a police official said.


"We are looking for the suspects and it appears to be a sectarian
killing," the official said on condition of anonymity.


The shooting comes just two days after authorities lifted a
curfew imposed last month when nine people were killed in the
restive town.


Sectarian violence between Pakistan's Sunni and Shiite
communities has claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late
1980s.


Shiites account for about 20 percent of Pakistan's 160 million
Sunni-dominated population.
