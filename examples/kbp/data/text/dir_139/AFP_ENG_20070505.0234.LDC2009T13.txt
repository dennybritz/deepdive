Police arrested Saturday a 19-year-old Tallinn resident who is
suspected of involvement in a wave of attacks against Estonian
computer servers.


"The criminal police have detained the first person who stands
accused in involvement in the recent cyber-attacks against
Estonian servers," Kristiina Herodes, spokeswoman for the
Estonian prosecutor's office, told AFP.


"Dmitri was posting on Internet forums calls to organise mass
attacks against Estonian servers, called the DdoS attacks,"
Herodes said.


"He collected addresses of crucial Internet sites in Estonia and
passed them in various Internet forums, instructing users to
attack servers in Estonia," she said.


"Dmitri is the first person detained, but the investigation
continues, as many of the attacks came from abroad, including
from Russia," she said.


Many government web sites in Estonia have been forced to shut
down during the past week because of the attacks.


The arrest follows rioting in Tallinn last week over the removal
of a Soviet war memorial.


Russians, including the large minority that lives in Estonia, see
the statue as a memorial to the millions of Red Army soldiers who
died fighting Nazism in World War II, while Estonians view it as
a reminder of 50 years of Soviet occupation.


The Bronze Soldier has been re-installed in a military cemetery
in Tallinn, where it is due to be formally inaugurated on May 8.
