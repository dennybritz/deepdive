US wholesale prices jumped a surprisingly sharp 1.0 percent in
March but inflation at the core level eased, the Labor Department
said Friday.


The producer price index (PPI) was steeper than the 0.7 percent
rise expected on Wall Street.


But the report showed "core" prices, excluding food and energy
and seen by some as a better gauge of future trends, was flat,
despite expectations for a 0.2 percent rise.


The 1.0 percent increase in PPI followed a 1.3 percent increase
in February. Producer prices have now risen 3.2 percent over the
past year, and core prices have risen 1.7 percent.


The rise in overall wholesale inflation stemmed from a sharp rise
in both food and energy prices, which rose 1.4 percent and 3.6
percent respectively.


Within the energy sector, gasoline prices rose 8.7 percent, while
natural gas prices increased 3.3 percent and liquefied petroleum
gas rose 6.5 percent in March.
