The rise in Poland's inflation rate accelerated in March, running
at 2.5 percent on a yearly comparison, official data showed
Friday.


Polish consumer price rises have been gathering pace over recent
months.


Inflation in February rose 1.9 percent year-on-year, after
climbing 1.7 percent on the same basis in January and 1.4 percent
in December 2006.


On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in March
from February, after increasing 0.3 percent in February from
January, the data released by the national statistics board
showed.


The March figures were slightly higher than analysts' forecasts
of 2.4 percent year-on-year inflation and an increase of 0.4
percent on prices compared to the previous month.
