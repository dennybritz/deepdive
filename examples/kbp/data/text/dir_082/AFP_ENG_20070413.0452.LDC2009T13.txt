Nigerian vice president Atiku Abubakar is not on the specimen of
the April 21 presidential poll ballot paper issued on Friday by
the electoral agency.


The names and photos of the other 24 presidential candidates for
the poll feature on the specimen ballot paper, published Friday
by several national newspapers.


Abubakar, 60, who has been President Olusegun Obasanjo's deputy
since May 1999, has in the past weeks been battling in court to
get his name cleared and inserted in the electoral list after he
was indicted for alleged corruption.


The Independent National Electoral Commission's final list of
those eligible to contest the election, made public last
Saturday, excluded Abubakar.


The Supreme Court, the nation's highest judicial instance, is
scheduled to give a final ruling on his case on Monday.


Abubakar is the candidate for Action Congress (AC), one of the
two main challengers to the ruling Peoples Democractic Party
(PDP) in the elections.


State governorship and parliamentary polls are to be held
Saturday.
