Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"I make an effort to play for the glory of my country with total
commitment. I am very disappointed by the way we were greeted
when we returned from the World Cup."


- Younis Khan turning down the Pakistan captaincy.


"Malinga likes to stand out, so he goes for unusual styles unlike
the other well-known cricketers."


- Colombo hairdresser Nishantha Jayasekera on his Sri Lanka fast
bowling client Lasith Malinga.


"You're dumb if you don't. As a captain you've got to look at all
scenarios but by no means was there a question of giving the game
up."


- New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming adamant that skippers have
to pay attention to run rates which could act as a tie-breaker
for semi-final places.


"We'd like to think that we are nowhere near playing our best
cricket just yet. I've been happy with what we have done so far
and I'm not surprised at all by what we've done."


- Australia captain Ricky Ponting.


"It has to be a confidence thing and they need to sort it out
because if they go and perform like that, like startled rabbits,
against South Africa, they will get crushed."


- Ian Botham worries about England's form.
