Marseille president Pape Diouf sparked an expected transfer
scramble on Friday when he admitted that star winger Franck
Ribery has a green light to leave the French club at the end of
the season.


Diouf fought tooth and nail to keep Ribery at the 1993 European
Cup winners last year, despite strong interest from the likes of
five-time Freench champions Lyon, Spanish giants Real Madrid and
Premiership outfit Arsenal.


But now he seems resigned to the France player's imminent exit.


"This season he is welcome to leave, although that is not to say
that he will automatically leave," Diouf told television channel
Infosport.


"I will be less intransigent this season than last in the case of
an eventual exit by Franck."


Meanwhile, Diouf said no decision had been made on whether or not
to exercise an option to buy on-loan Liverpool forward Djibril
Cisse at the end of the season.
