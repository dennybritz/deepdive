West Indies skipper Brian Lara was forced to defend the
controversial three changes made to the team which slumped to a
crucial World Cup defeat against South Africa on Tuesday.


West Indies dropped pace bowler Jerome Taylor while keeping faith
with Ian Bradshaw and Corey Collymore.


Batsman Marlon Samuels and all-rounder Dwayne Smith were also
axed in favour of Grenadian left-hander Devon Smith and debutant
batsman, Kieron Pollard.


"The fact of the matter is we went for experience. Collymore
bowled well on Tuesday," Lara told the Caribbean Media
Corporation.


"Bradshaw over the last couple of years has done good service for
West Indies cricket and we went for the experience of the guys
who sometimes know what to do in critical situations and that was
the team that was selected.


"There were other changes. There was young Smith who came in for
Dwayne Smith, young Pollard as well. We just tried something
different, tried a different combination to see if it would work.


"We've played four games in this Super Eight and before that
three games (in the preliminary round). We just wanted to find
the right combination and hope and pray that it worked out on the
day but again it didn't."


The West Indies lost the match by 67 runs to virtually end their
hopes of reaching the semi-finals.
