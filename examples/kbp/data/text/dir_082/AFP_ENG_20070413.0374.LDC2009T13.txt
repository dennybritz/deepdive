Ireland were 72-7 after 20 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against Australia here on Friday.


John Mooney was on 13 with Kyle McCallan on five.


Ireland had been 12-4 at one stage with Glenn McGrath bowling
Jeremy Bray for one, Shaun Tait dismissing William Porterfield
(one) and Niall O'Brien (one) in successive balls before McGrath
had Eoin Morgan caught by Matthew Hayden for one.


Andrew White, who took a nasty blow on the head from McGrath, was
the fifth man out caught by Brad Hogg off the veteran paceman for
six to make the score 32-5 in the 11th over.


Stuart Clark, playing in his first match of the World Cup, took
his first wicket when Brad Hodge caught Kevin O'Brien for 16.


Skipper Trent Johnston, born in Australia, made 17 before he was
clean-bowled by Tait with the total on 54 in the 17th over.


Defending champions Australia are unbeaten in the tournament with
eight points from four games. They now need just one more win to
make sure of a place in the semi-finals.


Australia made one change from the side which beat England in the
previous match, bringing in Stuart Clark in place of Nathan
Bracken.
