A book by Pope Benedict XVI to appear in Italian, German and
Polish bookstores on Monday is billed as his answer to popular
publications such as Dan Brown's best-selling "The Da Vinci
Code."


Journalists on Friday received advance copies of the Italian
edition of "Jesus of Nazareth," which attempts to reconcile the
historical figure of Jesus with that of the Gospels.


In the work, Benedict laments "the worst books, which destroy the
figure of Jesus and dismantle faith, filled with the supposed
results" of scriptural study -- a clear alllusion to "The Da
Vinci Code," which was harshly criticised by the Roman Catholic
Church.


"The interpretation of the Bible can become an instrument of the
Antichrist" if it goes down mistaken paths, he warned.


The pope, a respected theologian, also denounces "the temptation
to interpret Christianity as a recipe for progress and to
consider the quest for the common well-being to be the true goal
of all religions."


The book is being translated into 19 other languages, and will
soon be available in Latin America, where books by liberation
theologian Jon Sobrino were recently condemned by the Vatican.
