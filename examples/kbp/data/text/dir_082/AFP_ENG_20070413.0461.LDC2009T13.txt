A controversial British artist on Friday hoisted a flag in the
heart of London picturing swimming sperm and a message that
reads, "One Secret is to Save Everything."


Tracey Emin's flag, at 6.5 metres by 4.2 metres (21 feet by 14
feet), will fly above the Jubilee Gardens in the British capital
until July 31, with the parliament building and the London Eye as
backdrops.


It is the second flag in a series by several artists commissioned
by the Hayward Gallery.


Gallery director Ralph Rogoff said the phrase on the flag was in
line with the paradox and ambiguity the artist has become known
for.


Emin, a BritArt icon, gained particular attention for earlier
work that included a tent with the names of men she had slept
with and her unmade and dirty bed.
