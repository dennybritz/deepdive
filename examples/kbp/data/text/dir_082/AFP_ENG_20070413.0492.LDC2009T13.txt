A 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Japan's Izu Islands, in the
Pacific Ocean, on Saturday, according to geologists.


The undersea quake occurred at 3:11 am (1811 GMT) at a depth of
58 kilometres (32 miles), with its epicentre some 105 kilometres
northeast of Hachijo-jima island, the United States Geological
Survey said.


There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes.


A 7.3-magnitude earthquake in the western city of Kobe in January
1995 killed more than 6,400 people.
