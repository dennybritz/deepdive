Nobel Prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter received an honorary
degree from Leeds University in northern England Friday.


Pinter, who was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus in 2002,
was made a doctor of letters, the latest in a string of awards
for the 76-year-old who is considered Britain's greatest living
writer of drama.


A fierce critic of Prime Minister Tony Blair and his support for
the United States-led war in Iraq, Pinter has turned down the
offer of a British knighthood.


But he is one of Queen Elizabeth II's Companions of Honour and is
a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire
(CBE), one step below a knighthood.


Pinter's best-known works include "The Birthday Party," "The Dumb
Waiter" and "The Homecoming."


He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, joining the ranks
of figures such as Samuel Beckett, Saul Bellow, Ernest Hemingway
and John Steinbeck.
