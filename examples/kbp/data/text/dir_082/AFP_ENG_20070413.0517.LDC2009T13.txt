Cuban leader Fidel Castro has taken back a large part of the
reins of government as his health improves eight months after
surgery, his ally Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday.


"Fidel has nearly completely recovered" from the gastrointestinal
surgery that sidelined him in July, Chavez told a news
conference.


"He has taken back a good part of government functions, but, of
course, not formally."


"The information that keeps emerging, his notes, his voice on the
telephone, show a marked improvement (in his health)," Chavez
said. "But I don't want to say more."


Castro, 80, temporarily handed power to his brother and defense
chief Raul, 75, on July 31, four days after undergoing surgery.


He has only been seen in videos and pictures since July, but he
has published in the last two weeks three articles railing
against President George W. Bush, in a sign that he is still
closely following current events.


It is the first time that the Communist stalwart has given up the
reins of government since his guerrilla revolution toppled the
government of dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959.
