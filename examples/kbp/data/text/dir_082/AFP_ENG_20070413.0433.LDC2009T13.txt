A European human rights official said Friday that migrants
arriving in Europe were increasingly being mistreated and risked
being reduced to "slave work."


"We have a particular problem which is getting worse and worse in
Europe: our treatment of migrants," said Thomas Hammarberg, human
rights commissioner at the Council of Europe. "They are usually
treated as if they don't have rights at all."


Illegal immigration has been a growing issue in Europe, sparking
political debate between those in favour of harsh remedies and
those advocating a softer approach.


Hammarberg spoke of discrimination in other areas, saying Europe
has a "serious problem of xenophobia."


"We have to work against discrimination in our society --
discrimination against people with disabilities, discrimination
againt women, discrimination against those with another sexual
orientation, discrimination against those coming from other
countries," he said.


He named discrimination against members of the Roma community in
Europe as an area that must be addressed, as well.
