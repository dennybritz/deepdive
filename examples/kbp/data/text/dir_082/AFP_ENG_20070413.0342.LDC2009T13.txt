Ireland were 30-4 after 10 overs in their World Cup Super Eights
match against Australia here on Friday.


Kevin O'Brien was on 16 with Andrew White on four.


Ireland had been 12-4 at one stage with Glenn McGrath bowling
Jeremy Bray for one, Shaun Tait dismissing William Porterfield
(one) and Niall O'Brien (one) in successive balls before McGrath
had Eoin Morgan caught by Matthew Hayden for one.


Defending champions Australia are unbeaten in the tournament with
eight points from four games. They now need just one more win to
make sure of a place in the semi-finals.


Australia made one change from the side which beat England in the
previous match, bringing in Stuart Clark in place of Nathan
Bracken.
