Cuban leader Fidel Castro has taken back a large part of the
reins of government as his health improves eight months after
surgery, his ally Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday.


"Fidel has nearly completely recovered" from the gastrointestinal
surgery that sidelined him in July, Chavez said.


"He has taken back a good part of government functions, but, of
course, not formally."
