European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said here on
Friday that he would like to see a new European Union
constitution in place from 2009.


"The aim is to have a new treaty in 2009, before the next
European Parliament elections," he told the Portuguese
parliament.


"The starting point of this new treaty should be the text already
signed by all the member states and ratified by 18 countries."


This text has been in political limbo since its rejection during
referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005.


But German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country currently
holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU, has called for
an inter-governmental conference (IGC) to be set up in June to
start drawing up a new treaty.


Barroso said he hoped this conference would be created soon,
adding: "The European Commission is ready to give a positive view
(on launching an IGC) with the shortest possible delay.


"If in June, we can establish an ambitious calendar (to draw up a
new treaty), that would already be a big step."


The ex-Portuguese prime minister said he would come back to
Portugal, which takes over the EU presidency from Germany in
June, to "launch the IGC" with the support of the commission.


Barroso added that European heads of state should specify the
main themes of the new text at their summit in June, before
getting involved in its detail.


"A large part of the treaty's content should be kept and it is
important not to reopen too many questions," he said.
