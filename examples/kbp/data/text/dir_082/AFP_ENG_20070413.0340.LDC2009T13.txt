A US federal judge has dismissed an investors' class-action
lawsuit against pharmaceutical giant Merck related to its Vioxx
pain medication, the drug group said Friday.


The lawsuit had been filed by investors against Merck over
certain disclosures regarding Vioxx which Merck yanked from the
market in September 2004.


A clinical study had showed that patients who took the drug for
18 months or longer ran a higher risk of suffering a heart attack
or stroke.


Merck said in a statement that Judge Stanley Chesler of the US
District Court in Newark dismissed the case Thursday on technical
grounds, saying the plaintiffs and lawyers had waited too long to
file their lawsuit under statutes of limitations.


Merck's shares surged on the news and were up 3.41 dollars, over
seven percent, at 49.79 dollars in mid-morning deals.


The drug-maker has been fighting off thousands of lawsuits filed
over Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory agent that was used primarily to
treat arthritis and injuries.
