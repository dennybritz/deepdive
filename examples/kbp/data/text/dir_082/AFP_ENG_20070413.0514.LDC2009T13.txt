Fifteen German air force specialists arrived in Switzerland on
Friday to join a Swiss investigation into the crash of a German
Tornado military jet which killed the pilot, authorities said.


The 27 year-old pilot, who was not named, died when his low-
flying plane flew into a mountain side during a training flight
in central Switzerland on Thursday .


The 34 year-old navigator managed to eject before the crash, a
Swiss air force spokesman said.


He was found by a helicopter rescue team shortly after the crash,
hanging by his parachute from the cliff face, and was taken to
hospital suffering form slight injuries.


Swiss military investigators said at a press conference on Friday
that they had been able to speak to the navigator and were
looking for the aircraft's two black boxes.


Swiss air force spokesman Juerg Nussbaum said the Tornado
appeared to have been flying at altitudes just 300 metres above
the valley floor, which is surrounded by peaks that are up to
2,000 metres higher.


The Tornado was conducting a point-to-point navigation exercise
across the Swiss Alps on its way back to Germany, shortly after
refuelling at a Swiss airbase, he explained.


Six German Tornado jets were deployed in mountainous terrain in
Afghanistan last week to fly surveillance missions in support of
NATO-led troops battling Taliban rebels.


Their deployment was marked by political controversy in Germany.
