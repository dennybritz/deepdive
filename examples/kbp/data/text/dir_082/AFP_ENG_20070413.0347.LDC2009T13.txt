Kosovo police arrested seven men and seized a large quantity of
weapons and explosives after an armed attack on Kosovo's
telecommunication service chief, an official said.


The arrests were made Thursday, one day after Kosovo's
telecommunications service chief Anton Berisha escaped a second
attack unscathed. A policeman guarding him was critically
injured.


The weapons and explosives were found during the search of the
houses of several suspects, police spokesman Arber Beka told AFP.


"Along with the weapons and explosives, four Kosovo Albanians
were arrested," said Beka, adding that seven suspects have been
arrested so far.


Three other people were detained immediately after the attack on
Berisha near Malisevo, southwest of the capital Pristina.


The attack took place near the scene of from the first attack on
Berisha on February 28. He has been under police protection
since.


No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but local
media speculated it was linked to Berisha's role in awarding a
second mobile phone licence for the disputed Kosovo province.


Kosovo has been managed by a UN mission since mid-1999, after
NATO bombing ended a crackdown by Serbian forces on the
province's independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.


In coming weeks, the UN Security Council is to decide on Kosovo's
future status based on a recommendation by UN special envoy
Martti Ahtisaari for it to be granted internationally supervised
independence.
