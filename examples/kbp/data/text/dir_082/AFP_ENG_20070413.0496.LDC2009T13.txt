A Central African Republic rebel group signed a peace accord with
the government of President Francois Bozize on Friday.


"With the signing of this agreement, there will be no more
trouble, nor fighting. The population of Birao will be able to
live in peace," Bozize, who attended the signing ceremony, said.


The agreement was signed by Damane Zakaria, acting head of the
rebel Union of Democratic Forces for the Rally (UFDR), and for
Bangui, by General Raymond Ndougou, the principal architect of
the 10-point deal, an AFP journalist saw.


For his part Zakaria asked for a "pardon" from the people of
Birao and another town, Vakaga, "for everything they suffered as
a result of the rebellion."


"I promise to work for the return of peace in Birao," the rebel
leader added.


The UFDR held Birao for a month last November and launched
another attack on the town at the beginning of last month but
were repelled by government troops backed by French forces.


In the past two years the northern CAR has seen an upsurge in
violence by insurgents hostile to Bozize, who came to power in a
2003 coup but won presidential elections in May last year.


The government is assisted by a multinational force from other
states in the region as well as the French air force in its
attempts to repel rebel groups and reduce bandit attacks in the
north.
