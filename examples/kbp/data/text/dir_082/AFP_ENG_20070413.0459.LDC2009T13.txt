The Iraqi government spokesman warned Washington on Friday about
the consequences of a premature US pullout from Iraq, a day after
a suicide bomber penetrated Baghdad's parliament building.


"We feel that premature withdrawal would be a great gift for
those who did yesterday's attack, and definitely it will make a
vacuum of power in Iraq, which is not desired by anyone," said
spokesman Ali Dabbagh.


"That is why we feel that a job should be done collectively
between us and the international troops in order to get the Iraqi
forces ready to take responsibility," he told journalists at the
White House.


Dabbagh said it would be "difficult" to say how long US troops
would be needed in Iraq, but added that Iraq was on a "good"
path.


"There will be a speeding up of the training of the Iraqi forces
which will entitle the Americans, the Iraqi to negotiate ...
withdrawal," he said.


The US Congress is fighting to attach a deadline for troop
withdrawal to the release of billions of dollars in war spending
for Iraq and Afghanistan, a plan US President George W. Bush has
repeatedly promised to veto.
