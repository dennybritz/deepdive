A Zimbabwean woman fighting to protect girls from forced
marriage, sexual abuse and child labour on Friday won the World
Children's Prize for the Rights of the Child, the organisers
said.


More than five million children across the world voted for Betty
Makoni, the founder of the Girl Child Network in Zimbabwe, the
Swedish organisation with the same name as the prize announced.


"Tens of thousands of girls have known a better life thanks to
Betty's work," it said in a statement.


Honorary prizes have also been given to Burma's Cynthia Maung and
India's Inderjit Khurana for their work with children in their
respective countries.


The one million-kronor (100,000-euro) prize, sponsored by Swedish
companies, will be handed over on Tuesday in the presence of
Queen Silvia of Sweden.
