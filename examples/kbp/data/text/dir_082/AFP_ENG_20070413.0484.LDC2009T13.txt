Irish midfielder Bryan Byrne signed a contract with New England
Revolution of Major League Soccer here Friday.


The 24-year-old striker will not play in Saturday's season opener
here against Toronto FC as he awaits a work visa. Terms of his
deal were not disclosed.


Byrne was co-captain of the University of California Santa
Barbara team that won last year's US collegiate championship. He
scored 11 goals and had 19 assists for the Gauchos.


"We are pleased to have Bryan join our team," Revolution director
of soccer Michael Burns said. "He had tremendous success at the
collegiate level and we expect that he will have continued
success as a member of the Revolution."


The Revolution released defender Tony Lochhead, 25, who played in
16 games last season.
