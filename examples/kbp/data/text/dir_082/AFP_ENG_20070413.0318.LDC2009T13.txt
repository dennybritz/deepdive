Poland's balance of payments showed a substantially reduced
deficit in February, data from the country's central bank showed
on Friday.


The current account deficit fell to 424 million euros (571
million dollars), down from 733 million euros in January, the
bank said.


The February deficit was far below the 878 million euros forecast
by analysts.


In 2006, Poland's total balance of payments deficit had hit 6.27
billion euros, compared to 4.13 billion euros the previous year.


The current account is a broad measure of a country's commercial
relations with the rest of the world, painting a picture of trade
in goods and services along with certain financial transfers.


Poland's trade balance in February showed a deficit of 60 million
euros, a major decline from the deficit of 387 million euros in
January.


Polish exports climbed in February by 16.3 percent compared to
the same period the previous year to 8.056 billion euros.


Imports rose somewhat slower, increasing by 13.4 percent year-on-
year to 8.116 billion euros, the central bank said.
