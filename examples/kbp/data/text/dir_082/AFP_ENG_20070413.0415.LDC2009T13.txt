The governor of the northeastern US state of New Jersey was in
critical condition with several broken bones Friday after the car
he was in slammed into a guardrail, officials said.


Governor Jon Corzine was critical but stable, a spokesman from
Cooper University Hospital in New Jersey said, adding that the
governor was conscious and able to respond to basic questions.


State police said Corzine's vehicle swerved to avoid another
driver late Thursday and hit the guardrail. Corzine suffered
chest injuries, multiple rib fractures and a leg fracture,
hospital officials said.


Initial investigations suggested the governor was not wearing his
seatbelt at the time of the accident, Corzine's spokesman said.
Failure to wear a seatbelt carries a 20 dollar fine in the state,
according to justice officials.


Corzine was on his way to meet disgraced radio talk-show host Don
Imus, who was fired Thursday over racial slurs he made on air,
when the accident occurred, the governor's office said.
