An alliance of Sunni groups headed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq said in an
Internet statement on Friday that it carried out a deadly suicide
bomb attack inside the Iraqi parliament building.


"After studying the area... a hero from the Islamic state of Iraq
wearing an explosive belt infiltrated the apostates of the
parliament. Allah used his hand to destroy the group of
infidels," the self-styled Islamic Nation of Iraq said in the
Internet statement.


Thursday's bombing killed one parliamentarian and wounded 22
other people in the legislature's cafeteria, the US military said
on Friday, revising the previous day's toll down from eight
reported dead and 23 wounded.


"The right to legislate belongs to God alone, and whoever
disputes that is an apostate. The members of parliament deserve
only death," the Internet statement said.


"We delayed the announcement (claiming the bombing) to enable our
men to withdraw," it added, also threatening to launch "more
violent attacks."


Parliament convened in special session in Baghdad on Friday to
condemn the suicide bombing amid continuing confusion over the
final toll.


Although the US military numbered the dead and injured at one and
22 respectively, an Iraqi security official continued to put the
death toll at three -- "one deputy and two unidentified bodies."


Iraqi parliamentarians told Friday's special session that one
lawmaker, Sunni MP Mohammed Awad, had been killed in the blast.


They vowed that the spectacular breach of security would not
derail the political process.
