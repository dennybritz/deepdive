The second-ranking US general in Iraq said Friday that a suicide
attack on Baghdad's parliament showed there remained a "long way
to go" toward providing security in the war-ravaged country.


"It is clear that we still have a long way to go to provide
security and stability to the people of Iraq," said general
Raymond Odierno in a video news conference from Baghdad.


Asked how a bomber could have penetrated the heavily protected
Green Zone, where the blast on Thursday killed at least one
person and wounded 22 others, Odierno said an investigation was
underway.


"We simply don't know yet who was involved. Something didn't go
right," he said. "Somebody didn't do their job."


The general insisted that "steady progress is being made" in
Baghdad, where a massive security crackdown has been in place for
two months with boosted US troops and joint checkpoints flooding
the capital.


"But real success is based on sustaining progress over the long
term with, eventually, Iraqis alone providing security to their
people," he said.


An alliance of Sunni groups headed by the Iraqi branch of Al-
Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack according to a
statement posted on the Internet.
