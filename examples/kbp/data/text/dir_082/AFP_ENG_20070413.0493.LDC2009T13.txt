Venus Williams advanced to the semi-finals of the 1.34 million-
dollar WTA Charleston clay court tournament Friday by defeating
Spain's Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-4, 7-5.


Williams, who recovered from two breaks down in the second set,
will next face the winner of a later quarter-final between
Serbian second seed Jelena Jankovic and Slovenia's Katarina
Srebotnik.


Garrigues was serving for a 4-0 lead in the first set but
Williams broke, taking the crucial fourth game when the Spaniard
sent a backhand long, and broke again to level the set at 4-4.


Williams broke for the match in the 12th game when Garrigues sent
a backhand wide, the last of three consecutive unforced errors to
end the match.


Williams, a five-time Grand Slam champion, missed most of last
year with a left wrist injury, but the 26-year-old American has
been impressive this year, going 14-2 overall and winning a title
in February at Memphis.


Other quarter-finals were to send Russian fourth seed Dinara
Safina against France's Tatiana Golovin and Russia's Vera
Zvonareva against Dutch standout Michaella Krajicek.
