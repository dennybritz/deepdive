Russia's undefeated WBA heavyweight champion Nikolai Valuev
weighed a massive 90 pounds heavier at the weigh-in for
Saturday's title defence against Uzbekistan's Ruslan Chagaev.


The 33-year-old mammoth - who with a record of 46 wins, no
defeats and one no result is within three of equalling legend
Rocky Marciano's record 49 straight victories - weighed in at 319
lbs (144.7 kilogram) to Chagaev's 228lbs (103.5 kilogram).


Valuev, who will also have an 11 inch height advantage over
Chagaev, has had a greater weight difference before in one of his
world title fights, weighing in 105 1/2 lbs heavier than American
Monte Barrett.


Chagaev, whose training regime has included sparring with his
trainer standing on boxes to give him an indication of the height
difference, has a record of 22 wins, 17 inside the distance, and
one draw.
