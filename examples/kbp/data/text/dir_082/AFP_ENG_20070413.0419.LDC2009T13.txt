Kenya Football Federation officials on Friday said they would
legally challenge the formation of a renegade committee
attempting to overtake the running of the sport.


The embattled KFF, which was recently allowed to participate in
international football after a five-month ban, criticised the
country's registrar of societies of accepting the formation of
the parallel body.


"We intend to go to court to challenge their legality," said
Sammy Obingo, the KFF secretary, adding that the new panel was
illegally constituted.


"There are so many glaring discrepancies," Obingo said. "They
even went to forge people's signatures, including those of
officials who have since passed away."


Obingo said they would go to court next week.


The new committee, composed of officials representing the 19 KFF
branches countrywide, staged a coup last week saying they had
lost confidence in the national office headed by Mohammed Hatimy
and demanded fresh elections.


FIFA had already set May 31 as the date for fresh elections in
the KFF which has been involved in power struggles since being
elected in December 2004.


Kenya was suspended from international football because of
failure to fulfil a 28-point agreement reached in Cairo last year
and which called mainly for scrapping of parallel bodies managing
the sport.


The ban was only lifted earlier this month after an intervention
of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), which had sent
two top officials to Kenya to mediate in the row.
