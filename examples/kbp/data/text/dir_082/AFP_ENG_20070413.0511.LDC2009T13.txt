Central Cheetahs' prop Jannie de Plessis is to appear before a
special judicial panel Saturday accused of biting a Wellington
Hurricanes player in their Super 14 rugby match.


Du Plessis was cited following an incident involving Hurricanes
fullback Cory Jane midway through the second spell of Friday
night's match won by the Wellington side 37-15.
