Spanish rider Juan Jose Cobo won the fifth stage of the Tour of
the Basque Country on Friday, a 169km ride from Lekunberri to
Oiartzum.


The Saunier Duval rider's efforts means he takes the overall lead
at the expense of compatriot Angel Vicioso. Cobo leads by just
01sec ahead of Saturday's final stage, a 14km time trial.


He was part of a 14-man breakaway from the 43rd kilometre and he
dropped his fellow escapees on the col d'Erlaitz, the last tough
climb of this mountainous stage.


Vicioso faced constant attacks from the Saunier Duval team and
failed to organise the peloton into an effective chase group and
finally faced the reality of losing his yellow jersey by a single
second.
