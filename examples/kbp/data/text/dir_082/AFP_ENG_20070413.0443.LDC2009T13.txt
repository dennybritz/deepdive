Bayern Munich's German international midfielder Bastian
Schweinsteiger is out of Sunday's match against Bayer Leverkusen
as he struggles to overcome a mystery injury, his club said
Friday.


"We still don't know exactly what the problem is with his knee,"
said coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.


"He could be out another three days or it could last two to three
weeks."


Schweinsteiger had been out since last weekend, suffering from
brusing to his knee but now club doctors think he may have been
the victim of a tick bite. Ticks are a parasite that carry
viruses and are common in the south of Germany.


"That's just a hypothesis: he's had a blood test and we're
waiting for the results," said Hitzfeld.


Schweinsteiger missed Bayern's Champions League quarter-final
second leg against AC Milan, in which the Germans were beaten 2-0
- 4-2 on aggregate -to end their involvement in Europe this
season.


It's another blow for Bayern, currently trailing down in fourth
in their domestic league, as they have already lost French full-
back Willy Sagnol for the rest of the season.
