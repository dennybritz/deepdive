The Bavarian city of Munich will prepare a bid to host the 2018
winter Olympics if the nearby Austrian city of Salzburg fails in
its bid to host the Games in 2014.


Michael Vesper, the secretary general for the German Olympic
Committee (DOSB), said Munich would be their city of choice for
2018 in the event Salzburg misses out for 2014.


"Everyone dreams of hosting the Olympic Games, but you have to be
realistic and wait to see what happens regarding 2014 first,",
said Vesper.


"If Salzburg is named host of the 2014 Olympics then we will kiss
our 2018 candidature goodbye."


Salzburg is in a race to host the 2014 winter Olympics with
Pyeongchang in South Korea and Sochi in Russia.


The 2014 Games host city will be announced on July 4 in Guatemala
City.
