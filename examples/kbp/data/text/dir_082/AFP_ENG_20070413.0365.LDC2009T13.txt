A total of 17 people were injured on Friday during two
demonstrations against Israel's separation barrier across the
West Bank, Israeli public radio and Palestinian medics said.


The radio said Israeli police used tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse the demonstrators, made up of Palestinians and left-wing
Israeli activists.


Twelve people were lightly hurt near Bilin, close to the town of
Ramallah, it said. The AFP photographer at the scene said that
four local photographers were briefly detained.


Five other demonstrators were injured in Salmuna near Bethlehem.


The farming village of Bilin is the site of weekly clashes
between protestors against the controversial barrier and police,
who regularly use tear gas, rubber bullets and batons against
demonstrators.


Israel says the 700-kilometre (435-mile) long barrier, made up of
concrete walls and razor wire fences, is necessary to protect the
Jewish state against terrorists.


Palestinians say the barrier is a land grab which eats up chunks
of their promised state, separates farmers from their land and
splits families.


The International Court of Justice, in a non-binding decision,
ruled the barrier illegal in 2004. Israel has pressed on with
construction, which is 65 percent finished.
