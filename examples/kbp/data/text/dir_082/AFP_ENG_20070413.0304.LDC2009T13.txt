An alliance of Sunni groups headed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq said in an
Internet statement on Friday that it carried out a deadly suicide
bomb attack inside the Iraqi parliament building.


"After studying the area... a hero from the Islamic state of Iraq
wearing an explosive belt infiltrated the apostates of the
parliament. Allah used his hand to destroy the group of
infidels," the self-styled Islamic Nation of Iraq said in the
Internet statement.


Thursday's bombing killed one parliamentarian and wounded 22
other people in the legislature's cafeteria, the US military said
on Friday, revising the previous day's toll down from eight
reported dead and 23 wounded.
