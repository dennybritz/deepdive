Moscow's RTS stock market index hit an all-time high on Friday,
just weeks after a mini-crash.


The RTS index of 50 major companies closed 1.76 percent higher at
2,001.59 points, crossing the 2,000 point barrier for the first
time in its history, driven by Russian oil company Rosneft, which
rose more than 6.0 percent during the session.


In early March the Russian market lost more than five percent,
amid a global stock market slump that refleced concern about the
health of the US economy.
