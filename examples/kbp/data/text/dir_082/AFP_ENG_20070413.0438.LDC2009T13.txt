Former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix, who clashed with US
authorities over the Iraq war, said Friday he doubted Washington
would attack Iran over its nuclear development.


"I don't personally think the US would attack Iran, mainly
because people in the United States are tired of military
adventures," he said here, where he presented a report on weapons
of mass destruction.


Blix recognised there were similarities between the period before
the Iraq war and the nuclear showdown with Iran, but pointed out
there were also "big differences."


"Iraq in 2002 was down on its knee," he said. "We had more than
700 inspections."


The Swedish diplomat was named head of a United Nations team in
2002 tasked with conducting inspections for weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.


The United States and Britain led an invasion of Iraq in March
2003, using the weapons fears to justify the operation. Blix
later accused the US and British governments of exaggerating
Iraq's weapons threat to help build a case for war.


Weapons of mass destruction were never found in Iraq.


Blix is currently head of the independent Swedish Weapons of Mass
Destruction Commission.
