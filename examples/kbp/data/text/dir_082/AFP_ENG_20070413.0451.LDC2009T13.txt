Drug-resistant gonorrhea is spreading across the United States
and new treatments are needed to combat the sexually transmitted
disease, the federally run Centers for Disease Control said
Friday.


The CDC is so alarmed at the spike in cases of gonorrhea, one of
the most common STDs in America, that it is no longer
recommending doctors treat it with kind of antibiotics typically
prescribed in the past, it said in a statement.


The warning came after a study showed that the number of
gonorrhea cases in men rose dramatically in 26 US cities between
2001 and 2006.


A full 13.3 percent of cases were found to be resistant to
antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones in the first half of 2006,
compared to less than one percent in 2001.


"We are running out of options to treat this serious disease,"
said Dr. Kevin Fenton of the CDC, adding there was "an urgent
need for new, effective medicines to treat gonorrhea."


Previously, orally administered drugs known as ciprofloxacin,
ofloxacin and levofloxacin were prescribed to treat the disease.
Now the CDC is recommending a single class of antibiotics known
as cephalosporins, often administered by injection.


Gonorrhea is believed to affect 700,000 Americans each year and
is the second most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease
after chlamydia. Gonorrhea can cause sterility in men and women
and can make it easier to contract HIV.
