Spanish rider Juan Jose Cobo won the fifth stage of the Tour of
the Basque Country on Friday, a 169km ride from Lekunberri to
Oiartzum.


The Saunier Duval rider's efforts means he takes the overall lead
at the expense of compatriot Angel Vicioso. Cobo leads by just
01sec ahead of Saturday's final stage, a 14km time trial.
