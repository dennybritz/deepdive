A Pakistani passenger jet made an emergency landing in the
eastern city of Lahore Friday due to pressurisation problems,
airline officials said.


The Shaheen Airlines Boeing 737 was flying from Lahore to the
southwestern city of Quetta when it returned after 90 minutes, an
airline official said on condition of anonymity.


"There was low oxygen pressure in the plane and the captain
decided to cut short the journey," the official said.


Private Geo television, quoting passengers, reported the pilot
was forced to return after four passengers fainted mid-air.


The official did not confirm the report.


In July 2006 an ageing Fokker airliner operated by state-run
Pakistan International Airlines crashed shortly after take-off
near the central city of Multan, killing all 45 people on board.
