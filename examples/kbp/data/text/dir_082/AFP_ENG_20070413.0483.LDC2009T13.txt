Israeli troops arrested a Syrian national late on Friday on
Syria's Golan Heights after he had crossed to the Israeli side of
the territory annexed in 1981 by the Jewish state, Israel's
public television said.


A security source said that the man gave his age during
questioning as 24 and said that he was sick and was seeking
medical help.


Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have been frozen
since 2000. Damascus demands the return of the Golan which was
seized by Israel in 1967 and later annexed.


More than 15,000 Israelis have settled there.
