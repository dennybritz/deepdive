Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann could decide in the coming week
whether or not he will stay with the club.


The 37-year-old German veteran's contract expires at the end of
this season and Arsenal, in line with club policy on senior
players, are offering a 12-month extension.


Lehmann is thought to have wanted the security of a two-year deal
but claims he is close to making a decision.


He told Arsenal TV Online: "We will see. I think there will be a
decision within the next few days or next week.


"I would like to play here, I have always said I would like to
stay but it is a situation where no decision has been made yet.
It is difficult to talk about it (now)."


Arsenal, fourth in the Premiership but with only one point from
their last four games, face fifth-placed Bolton at home Saturday
in a crucial clash for both Champions League-chasing clubs.
