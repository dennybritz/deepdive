Thousands of people in northeast Spain were restricted to their
homes Friday after fire broke out in a coal mine and filled the
air with thick clouds of smoke, a civil protection officer told
AFP.


No-one was seriously injured in the fire near Sama de Langreo,
which has about 200,000 residents, although about 60 people were
given medical attention, Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa
Fernandez de la Vega said.


The fire is now under control, she told a press conference
following the government's weekly cabinet meeting.


Speaking earlier, the Asturias civil protection service said
about 20 people were hospitalised with respiratory problems, or
minor skin or eye irritations.


It said a slow fire broke out on a conveyor belt used to
transport coal early Friday.


Because of the huge amounts of smoke, emergency services had
trouble getting to it because access relies on two mine shafts.


The civil protection office said that "the concentration of
carbon monoxide and sulphur are below the level that requires an
alert and the concentration of the smoke is decreasing."


De La Vega said that "as a precaution, some residents were
evacuated and classes suspended, even if the situation was not
judged serious."
