The governor of the northeastern US state of New Jersey was in
critical condition with several broken bones Friday after the car
he was traveling in slammed into a guardrail, officials said.


Governor Jon Corzine was in critical but stable condition, a
spokeswoman from Cooper University Hospital in New Jersey said,
without giving fuller details. His office said further
information would be released later Friday.


According to local reports, Corzine's police vehicle swerved to
avoid another driver late Thursday and hit the guardrail. He had
reportedly broken one of his legs, sternum, collarbone, several
ribs and a vertebra.


Corzine was on his way to meet disgraced radio talk-show host Don
Imus, who was fired Thursday over racial slurs he made on air,
when the accident occurred, according to the reports.
