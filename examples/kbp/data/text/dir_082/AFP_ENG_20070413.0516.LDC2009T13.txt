The head of the African Union said Friday he "greatly deplores"
the cross-border clash that occurred between Chad and Sudan
earlier this week and pushed for talks between the countries.


Chadian troops chased rebels across the border with Sudan's war-
torn Darfur region on Monday, sparking a battle with the Sudanese
army. Khartoum said 17 of its troops were killed, while Chad
reported about 30 killed on the two sides.


In a statement released at its headquarters here, AU chairman
Alpha Oumar Konare "greatly deplores these cross-border clashes"
and urged the two governments "to exercise restraint and engage
once more in dialogue".


The statement said Konare "underscores that chief among the
commitments they have taken ... is the need to refrain from
supporting or serving as a refuge to their respective armed
oppositions, and the mutual respect of their sovereignty and
territorial integrity."


The clash was one of the most serious of its kind since the start
of the Darfur conflict between rebels and Khartoum's troops and
allied Janjaweed militia more than four years ago.


It heightened fears that fighting in western Sudan would
eventually spill over into neighbouring countries.


Chad apologised for this week's incident but Sudan insisted it
wanted further assurances.


Konare said the incident "will only heighten the tension between
the two countries, restrict access to humanitarian assistance and
increase the suffering of the civilian populations living in the
region."
