Saudi Arabian sprinters' 2008 Olympic hopes received a boost on
Friday with the announcement that quadruple Olympic sprint
medallist Ato Boldon had been hired as their coach.


The 33-year-old Trinidadian said he was quitting from his current
position as an Opposition Senator in the Trinidad and Tobago
Parliament and assuming his new post.


"I have agreed to become coach for the Saudi Arabian national
sprint team," he was quoted as saying by the Jamaica Gleaner.


"This is my first deal toward being a major track and field coach
and the channels will be open so that any elite track and field
athlete could pursue their Olympic dreams can now be coached by
me.


"There are things right now that I have to do while I am still at
this age and while I am still being given the opportunity. I feel
that it is a question of striking while the iron is hot," added
Boldon, explaining why he was resigning from politics.


In taking the job he would be joining up with former coach John
Smith, who is in charge of the Saudi track team when he is not
coaching his elite stable of athletes in California.


Boldon was one of the most talented sprinters of his generation
but had the bad luck to come up against his stablemate Maurice
Greene, otherwise known as the 'Kansas Comet' and who won Olympic
100m gold in 2000 and three world outdoor 100m titles as well as
the 1999 200m crown.


However Boldon, aside from his Olympic medals, also won the 1998
Commonwealth Games 100m title, the 1997 200m world championship
gold and three other minor medals at the world championships.
