Danish police used helicopters, divers and sniffer-dogs in an
intensive two-week search for a missing 82-year-old woman, who
was ultimately found dead under her own bed, media reported
Friday.


"We had been inside her house several times and thought we'd
searched it thoroughly. So our professional pride is hurting a
little bit," Niels Joergen Moeller of the Gentofte police north
of Copenhagen told television TV2 Lorry.


The woman, who disappeared on March 22, had committed suicide.
