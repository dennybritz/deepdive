Residents of an historic Prague neighborhood vote Friday on a
proposal to erect a monument to famed psychiatrist Sigmund Freud
-- with some saying they would prefer a goat statue instead.


The monument would be located in an area known as Kozi Placek, or
Goat Square, near the Old Town Square popular with tourists.


The city chose a bronze sculpture by Michal Gabriel that shows
the father of psychoanalysis, who was born in the eastern Czech
town of Priborborn, sitting at a table.


After the proposal drew criticism, officials decided to consult
the 2,300 voters in the neighborhood through a referendum.


An association called "Friends of the Goat" was formed, which
said a Freud monument could be placed anywhere, while "a statue
of a goat can only be situated on Goat Square."


Freud, who was known for his work with the subconscious, died in
1939.


"First, the statue is hideous, and second, Freud surely never
heard of Kozi Placek," said a woman in her sixties after voting.
"We should put a goat statue there instead."


Some seemed unaware of Freud's birthplace. He later moved to
Austria with his family.


"I would prefer to see a Czech and not an Austrian," said one
retired woman after voting no.


Results of the referendum were to be announced Friday night.


There has been increased attention on Freud in the Czech Republic
recently, with a museum in the house where he was born opening
last year.


Freud's theories were surpressed under the communist regime and
banned under the Nazi occupation.
