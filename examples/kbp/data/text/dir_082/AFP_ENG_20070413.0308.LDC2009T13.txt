A Swiss man pardoned from a 10-year prison sentence for insulting
the king of Thailand made a furtive return to his homeland on
Friday after being deported from the Asian kingdom.


Oliver Jufer, 57, landed at Zurich airport where authorities
quickly spirited him away from waiting photographers and
journalists, an airport official said.


Jufer's royal pardon came just two weeks after he pleaded guilty
to lese majeste -- offending the dignity of 79-year-old King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch.


In its first official statement on the pardon, the Swiss foreign
ministry welcomed his release and said that Swiss President
Micheline Calmy-Rey had expressed her gratitude to the king.


"Switzerland welcomes the release from prison and subsequent
transfer of Oliver Jufer," the statement said.


Security cameras videotaped Jufer spraying black paint on the
monarch's portraits during a drunken spree in the northern Thai
city of Chiang Mai on December 5, the king's birthday and a time
of national celebration.
