Bath's former France international winger David Bory is set to
join Brive next season, the French Top 14 club said Friday.


The 31-year-old, who made 18 appearances for France between 2000
and 2003, previously played for Clermont and Castres.


His last appearance for the national team was in the third place
play-off against New Zealand at the 2003 World Cup.


He has spent two years at Bath with whom he played in last
season's European Cup semi-finals.


He has signed a one-year deal with an option for a further year.
