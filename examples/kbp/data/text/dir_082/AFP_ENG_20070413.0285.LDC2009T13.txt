A Swedish father who risked his four-year-old daughter's life by
locking her in a fridge was charged Friday with child abuse, a
court in the central Swedish town of Sundsvall said.


"The man has been charged with two counts of child abuse against
his daughter," court clerk Margot Backman told AFP.


The man, whose name was not disclosed and who does not hold
Swedish citizenship, is accused of locking his daughter in the
family's refrigerator in June 2006. When the girl's mother found
her, her body temperature had dropped to 28 degrees Celsius (82.4
degrees Fahrenheit).


A body temperature that low can lead to death. The girl's life
was saved at hospital, Swedish news agency TT reported.


According to the charge sheet, the father also burned his
daughter with an iron in December 2005. Burn scars were found on
the girl's body.


The man has maintained his innocence.


According to TT, the man had already been sentenced to prison for
assaulting his wife.
