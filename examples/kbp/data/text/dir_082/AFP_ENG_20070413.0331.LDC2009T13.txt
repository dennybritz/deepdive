The data recorder from a Greek cruise ship that sank near the
Greek island of Santorini last week was discovered on Friday, the
ministry for the merchant navy said.


Using a submarine robot operated by remote-control, the device
was located at a depth of 85 metres (280 feet), following the
sinking of the Sea Diamond on April 5.


"The operation to raise the 'black box' is due to be carried out
during the day, mechanically, and with a prosecutor present," the
ministry said in a written statement.


Analysis of the data could shed light on the sinking of the
Greek-flagged ship. Two French tourists, a 45-year-old man and
his 16-year-old daughter, are still missing.


The ship hit a charted reef near the tiny island of Santorini and
sank the following morning to a depth of 140 metres.


Almost 1,600 passengers and crew were evacuated.


The Sea Diamond's captain and five officers have been charged
with causing a shipwreck through negligence, breaching
international shipping safety regulations and polluting the
environment.
