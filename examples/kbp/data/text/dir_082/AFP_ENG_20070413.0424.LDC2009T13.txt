Glenn McGrath took his 2007 World Cup wickets tally to 18 on
Friday and hopes his demolition of Ireland was a good omen for
the final here in two weeks' time.


The veteran seamer took 3-17 off seven overs with Shaun Tait
grabbing 3-39 as the Irish part-timers were bundled out for a
paltry 91 in the Super Eights clash.


"It would be nice to be back here for the final and then put my
feet up," said McGrath who will retire from cricket after the
World Cup.


"There was a little bit of bounce early on and it was good to get
some wickets. Early doors the ball carried through well. There
was really good bounce if you could get it consistent.


"There's a bit of life in the old fellah yet."


Australia, the defending champions, will make sure of their semi-
final place if they beat Ireland.
