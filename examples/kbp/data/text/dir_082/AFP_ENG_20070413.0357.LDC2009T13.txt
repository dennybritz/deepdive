A hardline Catholic party on Friday failed in a bid to change the
Polish constitution and open the way for a total ban on abortion
in a country which already has some of the strictest rules in
Europe.


The far-right League of Polish Families (LPR), which is a junior
member of Poland's conservative-led coalition government, had
sought to have an uncompromising "right to life from the moment
of conception" written into the constitution.


Some 165 MPs voted for the LPR proposal, 137 were against and 111
abstained.


Under Polish law, constitutional amendments must win backing from
two-thirds of those present in the chamber -- requiring the LPR,
which only has 29 seats, to muster a total of 276.
