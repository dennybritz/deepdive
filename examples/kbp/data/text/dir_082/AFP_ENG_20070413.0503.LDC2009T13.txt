UN chief Ban Ki-moon said Friday that he was sending his top
legal adviser to Lebanon to help rival parties find common ground
on the proposed establishment of an international court regarding
the murder of Lebanese ex-premier Rafiq Hariri.


"I intend to dispatch Nicolas Michel to Lebanon next week to
offer his legal assistance to the Lebanese government and
political leaders to help" with efforts to secure Lebanese
parliamentary ratification of the deal to set up the UN-backed
court, Ban said.
