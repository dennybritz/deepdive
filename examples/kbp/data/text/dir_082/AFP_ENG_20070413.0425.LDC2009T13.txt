The United States and Ukraine are cooperating on missile defense
issues, but Washington has not sought Kiev's involvement in a
controversial plan to deploy anti-missile interceptors in eastern
Europe, a US official said Friday.


The discussions with Ukraine concern technological issues and
relate to the former Soviet republic's experience and capacities
as a one-time base for the Soviet Union's nuclear missile force,
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.


"People have always talked to the Ukrainians because they, like
the Kazakhs, have the actual ability to throw things into space,"
the official said.


The official denied press reports in Ukraine and Russia that
Washington had sought Ukraine's involvement in a project to place
anti-missile radar and interceptors in eastern Europe -- a plan
that has drawn sharp protests from Moscow.


"That's just Poland and the Czech Republic, that's the only
people we're negotiating with," the official said.


Washington wants to build a radar system in the Czech Republic
and put missiles in neighboring Poland to defend against what it
says are potential attacks from "rogue" states such as Iran.
