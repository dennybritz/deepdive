The US Osprey aircraft is to spread its wings in Iraq for the
first time from September despite suffering fatal accidents and
serious setbacks during development, officials said Friday.


It will be "truly a historic day for your Marine Corps," said the
commander of the Marine Corps, General James Conway.


"The quantum leap in technology that this aircraft will bring to
the fight has been a road marked by some setbacks, lots of
sacrifices, and the success of these Marines standing before you
today."


Thanks to its revolutionary design with two tilting sets of
rotors mounted on its wings, the V-22 Osprey takes off like a
helicopter, but then flies forward like a plane.


Conway stressed that a squadron of specialized Marines would be
deployed in Al- Asad in Iraq from September to fly the aircraft.


"We've gone through a very deliberate process to ensure that
operationally, logistically, that the squadron and the aircraft
is ready to deploy," added Lieutenant General John Castellaw,
deputy commander for aviation.


Each aircraft costs 68 million dollars, and has been jointly
built by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing.


In the long run, it will replace the Marines CH-46 helicopters
which date from the Vietnam War.


First conceived some 20 years ago, the Osprey has hit numerous
setbacks and had several accidents which have claimed about 30
lives.
