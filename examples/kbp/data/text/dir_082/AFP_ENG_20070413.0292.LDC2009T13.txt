The European Union's energy commissioner Andris Piebalgs said on
Friday that the EU bloc should diversify its supplies of natural
gas to reduce dependance on Russian giant Gazprom.


As regards natural gas "we should diversify ... try to get gas
from any supplier, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iraq
and Iran in the future" he said during a visit to Athens in
response to questions about the EU's dependance on Russian gas.


He said that the problem the EU faced was the monopoly enjoyed by
Gazprom, rather than dependance on Russia itself.


He also urged partners in a new pipeline project between Greece
and Turkey from the Caspian Sea to use gas from another supplier
than Russia.


The Greek media has reported that Russia is piling on pressure
for the pipeline, which is to open in July, to use Russian gas.
Washington has already warned Athens against turning to Russia
for the pipeline's supplies.


Stretching over 300 kilometres (186 miles), 209 kilometres of
which is on Turkish territory, the pipeline will transport gas
from Azerbaijan and other Caucasus producers to European
countries.
