Former Nobel Peace prize winner and Polish president Lech Walesa
has written to UEFA president Michel Platini declairng his
support for the joint Poland/Ukraine bid for the 2012 European
Championships it was revealed on Friday.


Walesa, who founded the Solidarity Union movement in 1980, which
took on the then Communist Soviet Union backed regime, said that
choosing their bid would send the clear message how western
Europe had appreciated the dramatic changes that had taken place
in eastern Europe over the past 15 years.


"Winning the bid would send the clearest signal that the changes
in our part of Europe over the last 15 years have been noticed
and appreciated by western Europe," he wrote in a letter seen by
AFP.


"I am convinced that we are in the middle of organising a
championships of the highest level and that those people who
support it will not regret their decision."


Walesa recalled in his letter to Platini that he had seen the
legendary French footballer when he came to play in Gdansk - the
birthplace of Solidarity where Walesa worked in the shipyards -
for his Italian club Juventus in September 1983.


"It was the era of the communist regime and the stadium was
encircled by cordons of police armed to the teeth," wrote Walesa.


"Today thanks to the Poles and Solidarity the Iron Curtain is no
longer extant and Europe is reunited."


UEFA will decide on Wednesday in Cardiff who wins the right to
host the 2012 championships - the other candidates are another
joint bid of Hungary and Croatia and Italy.
