A strong earthquake shook the bed of the southeast Pacific ocean
west of Chile on Friday, the United States Geological survey
reported.


The quake, measuring 6.1 on the open-ended Moment Magnitude
scale, struck the southern part of the East Pacific Rise, an
expanse of sea floor lying between South America and the islands
of the South Pacific, at 1824 GMT.


The epicenter was 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) underwater at a point
more than 1,960 miles (3,200 km) west of the Chilean coastal town
of Osorno and 1,440 miles (2,320 km) east-southeast of the tiny
British territory of Pitcairn Island.


The Moment Magnitude scale measures the area of the fault that
ruptured and the total energy released.
