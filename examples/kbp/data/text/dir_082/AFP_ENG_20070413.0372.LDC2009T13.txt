Polish lawmakers on Friday rejected a handful of amendments which
aimed to anchor the country's anti-abortion law, already among
the strictest in Europe, in the constitution.


Members of parliament first turned down a proposal by the
hardline Catholic League of Polish Families (LPR), which had
sought to have an uncompromising "right to life from the moment
of conception" written into the constitution, opening the way for
a total ban on abortion.


In a further round of voting, they rejected separate proposals by
conservative President Lech Kaczynski, who had sought to set the
country's current restrictive law in stone and prevent any
liberalisation by future administrations.
