EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou will meet Russian
Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev on Saturday, in a bid to get
Moscow to lift its embargo on Polish farm products, the European
Commission said Friday.


The meeting will take place "on an informal basis" in Cyprus,
Kyprianou's home country, said spokesman Philip Tod.


In response to "technical" questions from the Russian side,
Brussels will also provide new information to the authorities
there in a bid to convince them to drop the embargo on Polish
meat and other foodstuffs in place since November 2005.


The EU's executive arm believes that there were problems in
Poland's veterinary and food hygiene sectors in the past but that
Poland is now complying with EU legislation and has made
sufficient progress to justify a lifting of the embargo.


Russia accuses Polish authorities of fraud in the implementation
of food safety standards.


But Poland argues that Moscow is playing politics because of
differences with the conservative government in Warsaw.


The problem has taken on wider proportions since Warsaw has
vetoed the opening of talks between the European Union and Russia
on a new partnership agreement because of the Russian ban.
