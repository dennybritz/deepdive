A deal has been struck to end a day-long wildcat strike by
firefighters and security staff which closed down Brussels
airport Friday, a union representative said.


"The strike is over" Benoit Tire, a representative of the
security staff union told AFP.


The action began at 6:00 am (0400 GMT) and immediately created
chaos with only the smallest planes able to leave the Belgian
capital's airport and incoming flights diverted to other airports
in Belgium, France and the  Netherlands.


Later airport authorities formally closed down all flight
operations for safety reasons, as fire crews were not available
in case of an accident.


The action, over pay for the firefighters and over alleged
management bullying by the security officers, led to chaos, with
many  flights cancelled and passengers at the airport complaining
of a lack of information.
