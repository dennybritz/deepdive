An overweight teenager who managed to hide her pregnancy stabbed
her baby to death after giving birth on the laundry room floor,
local media reports.


The baby was found with 135 stab wounds in a trash can outside a
suburban Minneapolis home, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported
Friday.


Nicole Beecroft, 17, was charged with first-degree murder
Thursday after an anonymous tip led police to her home.


The teen initially told police that she went to the bathroom
about 3:00 am Monday because "something didn't feel right."


Thinking the trash had been collected already, Beecroft said she
gave birth on a towel on the laundry room floor and lay with her
stillborn baby for 10 to 20 minutes before throwing it in the
trash can.


But when police found the bloody infant, Beecroft changed her
story and said she "panicked" and stabbed the baby girl after
seeing her move a finger.


"She could have walked away and the baby would have been adopted
by a family that wanted it," County Attorney Douglas Johnson told
the paper, noting that mothers are allowed to abandon their
babies at any hospital within 72 hours of birth with no legal
consequences.


"Instead she destroys two lives: her own and the baby's. We don't
know what motivated her," Johnson said.
