Two Pakistani soldiers were killed and another seriously injured
in a landmine blast in the country's gas-rich southwestern
province of Baluchistan on Friday, officials said.


A banned militant group representing tribesmen seeking more
profits from the region's natural resources claimed
responsibility for the attack in Manjra Taratani area, 450
kilometres (270 miles) southeast of Quetta.


The soldiers were accompanying a minesweeping team when the blast
happened, security officials told AFP.


"We laid the landmine in Manjra Taratani area," Beeberg Baloch, a
spokesman for the Baluchistan Liberation Army, told AFP by
telephone.


Rebel tribesmen launched an insurgency in oil-rich Baluchistan
province in late 2004, fuelled by claims that foreign investors
and richer neighbouring provinces were creaming off profits from
the region.


The violence, including attacks on railways, electricity lines
and government installations, subsided after rebel chieftain
Nawab Akbar Bugti was killed by the army in August 2006 but has
risen again in recent months.
