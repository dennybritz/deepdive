Six political activists arrested on sedition charges in Swaziland
have had their bail application postponed until next week, their
lawyer said Friday.


The six were arrested during a protest against the southern
African kingdom's ban on political parties at the border with
South Africa on Thursday.


Their lawyer Leo Gama said the six were reportedly found in
possession of seditious pamphlets.


The six include the founder of government's strongest opponents,
the People's United Democratic Movement (Pudemo), Mphandlana
Shongwe who is currently on bail after being linked to a spate of
firebombings.


Gama said they would apply for bail in the high court early next
week.


Despite having implemented a new constitution last year,
political parties are not allowed to take part in elections. Pro-
democracy activists have also complained about King Mswati III
and the lavish life he leads with 13 wives.


Swaziland, though peaceful, is wracked by widespread corruption,
nepotism and crippling poverty with the highest HIV rates in the
world.
