Malaysian share prices are expected to trade higher in the week
ahead as the outlook remains positive for the market and the
economy, analysts said Friday.


Danny Oh, a senior analyst with Mercury Securities, said that
trading in the past week had been "frantic" after the Kuala
Lumpur Composite Index breached a major resistance level of 1,285
points.


The benchmark index also achieved a new 13-year high midweek,
with property and oil and gas stocks in the limelight.


"In light of the current situation, which is largely momentum and
liquidity driven, the bullish stride is seen to maintain,
especially if regional and global markets do not reverse
abruptly," said Oh.


For the week ending April 13, the Kuala Lumpur composite index
gained 29.28 points or 2.24 percent to 1,278.92.


Average daily volume for the week was 2.19 billion shares, valued
at 2.83 billion ringgit (822.67 million dollars), rising from
1.88 billion shares worth 2.23 billion ringgit the previous week.
