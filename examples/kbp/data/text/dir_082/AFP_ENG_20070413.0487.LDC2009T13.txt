A Central African Republic rebel group signed a peace accord with
the government of President Francois Bozize on Friday.


The agreement was signed by Damane Zakaria, acting head of the
rebel Union of Democratic Forces for the Rally (UFDR), and for
Bangui, by General Raymond Ndougou, the principal architect of
the 10-point deal, an AFP journalist saw.
