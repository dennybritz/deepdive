The Nigerian government has ordered the closure of its land and
sea borders for 12 hours on Saturday to "ensure a hitch-free
electoral process", Interior Minister said in a statement Friday.


"The federal government has directed that all Nigeria's borders,
excluding air borders, should be closed from 6 am (0500 GMT) to 6
pm (1700 GMT) on Saturday," Oluyemi Adeniji said in the
statement, read to AFP.


"This is part of government measures to ensure a hitch-free
electoral process during the gubernatorial and state assembly
elections" on Saturday, added the statement.


Nigeria has land borders with Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger.


Travellers this week noted the reinforcement of security along
the Lagos-Cotonou international expressway, with more checkpoints
set up.


State governorship and parliamentary polls are scheduled for
April 14, while presidential and National Assembly elections are
slated for April 21, in what could be Nigeria's first civilian-
to-civilian transition since the nation gained independence from
Britain in 1960.
