US shares opened stronger Friday as a key inflation gauge soothed
some investors fears over rising prices which are being tracked
closely by the Federal Reserve, market participants said.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 35.44 points (0.28
percent) at 12,588.40 several minutes after the opening bell was
rung.


The tech-rich Nasdaq composite had gained 0.63 points (0.03
percent) to 2,480.95 while the Standard and Poor's 500 broad-
market index was 1.80 points (0.12 percent) higher at 1,449.60.


Stock prices moved higher after the government reported that US
wholesale prices jumped a sharp 1.0 percent in March, but
inflation at the core level eased and this appeared to reassure
some investors.


The report showed that "core" prices, excluding volatile food and
energy prices and seen by some as a better indicator of future
trends, were flat, despite expectations for a 0.2 percent rise.


"Traders seem to be taking heart that inflation doesn't appear to
be spreading to a wider range of goods," said John Wilson, an
equity strategist at Morgan Keegan.
