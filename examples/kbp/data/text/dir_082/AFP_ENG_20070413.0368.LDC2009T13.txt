The European Commission urged Turkey on Friday to play a
"constructive" role in Iraq a day after Turkey's army chief
called for a military incursion into northern Iraq to hunt
Turkish Kurd rebels.


"The stability of Iraq is in our common interest," Commission
spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy told AFP.


"The EU recognizes the constructive role Turkey plays in the area
and in this context it is important that Turkey continues to play
such a positive role," she added.


In a rare press conference at the army headquarters, General
Yasar Buyukanit pushed on Thursday for a cross-border operation
into northern Iraq to crack down on Turkish Kurd rebels he said
had sought refuge there.


"The EU is following the situation in the region very closely,"
said Nagy. "Our hope and the interest of all involved is that
possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and
constructive manner."


Turkey has accused Iraqi Kurds of tolerating, and even backing
the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a bloody
campaign for Kurdish self-rule in Turkey's southeast since 1984.
The conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives.


Ankara says thousands of militants of the PKK enjoy unrestricted
movement in northern Iraq and are able to obtain weapons and
explosives there.


The group is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey and much of
the international community.
