Japan's opposition camp appeared set to win at least one of two
upper-house by- elections Sunday, in a test to Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe ahead of national polls in July, news reports said.


Teruhiko Mashiko, jointly backed by the main opposition
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and a minor opposition group, was
projected to beat a candidate of Abe's ruling coalition and a
communist candidate in rural Fukushima, the Jiji and Kyodo news
agencies said.


In the remote island chain of Okinawa, a candidate from a DPJ-led
alliance and a rival from the coalition led by Abe's Liberal
Democratic Party were "in a close contest," Kyodo said citing
exit polls.


The by-elections were held along with local elections in most of
Japan's 47 prefectures to elect mayors and chiefs in 77 cities,
96 towns and villages and 13 wards in Tokyo. Seats in about 780
local assemblies were also contested.


The poll results will set the tone for July's national elections,
in which Abe's ruling coalition, which includes the Buddhist-
backed New Komeito, defends its slim majority in the House of
Councillors, the upper chamber of parliament.
