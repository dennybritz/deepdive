The German presidency of the European Union expressed concern
Sunday over "irregularities" in the Nigerian elections and the
outbreak of bloodshed in some regions.


"These incidents have given rise to concerns that not all
Nigerians entitled to vote really were able to do so freely and
without fear," it said in a statement.


It said the presidency would carefully examine the final report
by EU election observers as well as the embassies of member
states in Nigeria.


The presidency urged the Nigerian government to ensure "that
there are no doubts about the credibility of the election
results."


Nigeria on Saturday held a presidential poll and concurrent
legislative elections in what was intended to be the first
civilian-to-civilian transfer of power since independence in
1960.


But election delays and ballot-box mayhem, along with violence,
marred the vote in Africa's most populous nation.


One of the three leading contenders in the race for the
presidency, Vice President Atiku Abubakar, called Sunday for the
election to be re-run after widespread chaos with ballot papers
and charges of voter fraud.


And EU observers monitoring the elections criticised the
organisation of the poll in the north, citing under-age voting
and a failure to guarantee secrecy of the ballot.
