Spanish second division club Valladolid confirmed their return to
the top flight after a three year absence with a 2-0 win at
Tenerife on Sunday.


Former Spanish international Victor Fernandez opened the scoring
after 25 minutes and Bulgarian striker Vladimir Manchev added a
second four minutes from the whistle to clinch promotion for
Valladolid with eight matches to go.


Valladolid, one of the founders of the Spanish league in 1928 and
who also started its inaugeral season in the second tier, return
on the back of a phenomenal 28-game unbeaten streak which
stretches back to last October.


Promotion has delighted Valladolid supporters but come as a
relief to the club's sporting director Jose Luis Caminero and his
family.


"At the end of last year, I promised not to get my hair cut until
we either lost or got promoted," said the former international
midfielder and Valladolid icon who was part of Spain's 1994 World
Cup squad.


"I'll be definately going to the hairdresser sometime in the next
few days," added a happy Caminero, whose mane is currently
brushing his shoulders.
