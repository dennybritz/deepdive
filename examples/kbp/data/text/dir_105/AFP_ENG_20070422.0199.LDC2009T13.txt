Two-time champions the United States were handed a tough
assignment in the draw for this year's Women's World Cup on
Sunday.


The world's number one side were ranked alongside Sweden,
runners-up in 2003, and Asia's top team North Korea in Group B.


The US, many people's favourites for the title, will also face
Nigeria.


Reigning champions Germany were given a relatively easy ride
against Japan, England and Argentina in Group A.


The draw also smiled on hosts China, runners-up in 1999, who will
play Denmark, Brazil and New Zealand in Group D.


World number three Norway will play Ghana, Australia and Canada
in Group C.


The fifth World Cup will be played from September 10-30 across
five Chinese cities: Wuhan, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Shanghai and
Tianjin.


The top two teams from each group progress to the quarter-finals.
