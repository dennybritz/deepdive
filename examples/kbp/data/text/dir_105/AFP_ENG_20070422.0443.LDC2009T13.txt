Tensions died down late Sunday in Senegal's southern city of
Kolda, a day after violent clashes between police and protestors
left one man dead.


Senegal's armed forces minister Becaye Diop, also mayor of Kolda,
met with residents to defuse the violence which followed the
funeral of 23-year-old Dominique Lopy, who died in police custody
last weekend.


Lopy had been picked up on suspicion of stealing from an
official.


Diop talked with officials and youths in the home of a city
elder, according to an AFP correspondent at the scene.


Several residents told AFP they blamed Lopy's death on injuries
he had suffered while in custody.


One of two civilians injured in the clashes died late Saturday,
while the second was still in intensive care Sunday.


"I will take all measures necessary to evacuate the injured
(civilian)" to Dakar, Diop told his audience which included some
of Lopy's relatives.


Addressing young locals, he warned: "You mustn't put yourself in
a position  of confrontation with the security forces because you
will lose out."


Three police officers were injured Saturday when their vehicle
overturned while they were chasing the protestors. Local police
chiefs refused to comment on Saturday's clashes.


In the central district of Doumassou, where both Lopy and the
latest victim of the violence lived, the streets were quiet
Sunday.


Local youths had clashed with police over this issue once before,
on April 14, just after Lopy's death was announced.


Lopy's family said there was an autopsy report on his death but
it had not been released for security reasons.
