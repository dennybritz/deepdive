The Jordanian parliament passed legislation Sunday clearing the
way for the small energy-poor kingdom to develop nuclear power,
the official Petra news agency said.


Jordan is the latest in a string of Sunni Arab countries to
announce plans to develop civil nuclear programmes in the face of
the controversial programmew of Shiite Iran. Egypt and the pro-
Western Gulf states have already unveiled similar projects.


The new law "authorises the use of nuclear energy in the
production of electricity and the desalination of water to meet
growing demand in both areas," Petra said.


Jordan, which currently depends on imports for 95 percent of its
energy needs, plans to bring a first nuclear power station into
operation by 2015.


Power generation for water desalination is a major goal with the
kingdom one of the 10 poorest countries in the world in terms of
water resources.
