German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was troubled by an
"unacceptable intolerance" in Turkey in the wake of the brutal
killings of three Christians in the predominantly Muslim country.


"Everything must be done to prevent a climate that makes such
horrible murders possible," Merkel told the daily Muenchener
Merkur in an interview to be published Monday.


She said she expected "clear action so that intolerance against
Christianity and other religions does not have a chance."


However Merkel, whose conservative Christian Democratic Union
opposes Turkish membership of the European Union, said
Wednesday's murders would have no influence on Ankara's bid to
join the bloc.


"Open-ended negotiations (on Turkey joining the EU) will
continue," she said.


The murders of a German and two Turkish converts to Christianity
were the latest attack on minorities in Turkey following the
killings of a Roman Catholic priest last year and an ethnic
Armenian journalist in January.


Turkish media have speculated that the assailants belong to a
nationalist Islamist cell similar to one in the northern city of
Trabzon blamed for the murder of the journalist, Hrant Dink.


Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, is
governed by a left- right coalition. The Christian Democrats'
partners in power, the Social Democrats, back eventual Turkish
membership in the bloc.
