Poland will maintain its veto on new talks between the EU and
Russia, Poland's prime minister said Sunday after negotiations
failed to lift Moscow's embargo on Polish meat.


"Everything remains as before," Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski
said, cited by PAP news agency. "We do not agree to opening
discussions with Russia on a new agreement as long as this issue
is not settled."


EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou and Russian Agriculture
Minister Alexei Gordeyev failed to broker a deal on Sunday that
would have seen Moscow lift its embargo on Polish meat and plant
products.


The row has taken on wider proportions since Warsaw vetoed the
opening of talks between the European Union and Russia on a new
partnership agreement.


That broad economic cooperation agreement is to be aimed, among
other things, at securing a reliable flow to Europe from Russia's
massive oil and gas fields.


Russia accuses the Polish authorities of lax practices over food
safety standards. It imposed the embargo in November 2005.


Warsaw argues that the ban is a politically motivated move
against the former Soviet satellite state, now an EU member.


Kyprianou said Sunday that talks between Russian and EU officials
would continue on the embargo, but a new date has not been set
for negotiations.


Germany's foreign minister said last weekend that he hoped the
issue would be resolved in time for the next EU-Russia summit
beginning May 18.
