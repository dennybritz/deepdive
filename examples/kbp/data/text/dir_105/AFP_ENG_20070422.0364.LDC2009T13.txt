Mamelodi Sundowns retained the South African title on Sunday
without kicking a ball when sole challengers Orlando Pirates
dropped two points.


The 'Buccaneers' were held 0-0 by Ajax Cape Town in Johannesburg
and lost their slim mathematical chance of overtaking Sundowns,
who were eliminated  from the African Champions League by holders
Al-Ahly in Egypt at the weekend.


But the race for second spot and a place in the 2008 Champions
League draw beside Sundowns is far from over with nine clubs in
contention led by Moroka Swallows, who are 12 points adrift of
Sundowns.


Bottom placed Maritzburg United appear set for automatic
relegation from the richest national league on the continent,
leaving AmaZulu and Benoni United fighting to avoid finishing
second last and going into promotion playoffs.


Second division champions Free State Stars are certain to go up
and the next three clubs on the final standings will enter a
series of two-leg playoffs with a top-flight club.
