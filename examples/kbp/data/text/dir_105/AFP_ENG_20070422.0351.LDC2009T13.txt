A 93-year-old Frenchwoman died in a polling booth in western
France on Sunday moments before casting her vote to elect the
country's next president.


The elderly woman was found to have died of natural causes,
according to electoral officials in the Atlantic port of Saint
Nazaire, who briefly closed the polling station to allow funeral
workers to collect the body.


French voters turned out in record numbers to choose a successor
to President Jacques Chirac, 74, who steps down next month after
leading the country for 12 years.
