Serena Williams will not play for the United States here Sunday
because of an inflamed right knee as the Americans try to
eliminate Belgium and advance to the Fed Cup semi-finals.


Reigning Australian Open champion Williams, a seven-time Grand
Slam singles winner, and elder sister Venus Williams each won
singles matches Saturday to give the US women a 2-0 edge in the
best-of-five matchup.


But US captain Zina Garrison announced before Sunday's matches
that Serena Williams had a slightly inflamed right knee and Vania
King, ranked 83rd in the world, would replace here against
Kirsten Flipkens.


Venus Williams will face Caroline Maes. Both Belgians would have
to win to give them a chance to advance by claiming the
concluding doubles match, in which King and Lisa Raymond would
face Tamaryn Hendler and Yanina Wickmayer.


The winner will face Russia in a semi-final in July.
