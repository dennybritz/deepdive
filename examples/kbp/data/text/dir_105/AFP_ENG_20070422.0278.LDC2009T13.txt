Ten people were missing in southern Chile Sunday, one day after a
strong 6.2-magnitude earthquake, as a strong aftershock further
rattled the region.


Seismologists at the University of Chile measured a 5.6 Richter
scale magnitude temblor Sunday near Chile's border with Argentina
at 1022 GMT. The quake struck near the city of Valparaiso, some
120 kilometers west of Santiago.


The strong aftershock follows Saturday's quake 45 kilometers
northwest of Coihaique, Chile.


That quake's 6.2-magnitude reading was based on the open-ended
Moment Magnitude scale, which measures the area of the fault that
ruptured and the total energy released.
