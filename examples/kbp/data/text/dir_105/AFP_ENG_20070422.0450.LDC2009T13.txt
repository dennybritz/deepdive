England and the West Indies have been fined for slow over-rates
during their World Cup Super Eights match here on Saturday.


Match referee Ranjan Madugalle imposed the fines after Michael
Vaughan's side was ruled to be two overs short and Brian Lara's
side one over short of their targets at the scheduled finish when
time allowances were taken into consideration.


"In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing
over-rate penalties, players are fined five per cent of their
match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the
allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount," said
an ICC statement.


"As such, Vaughan has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee
while his players have each received ten per cent fines whereas
Lara has been fined 10 per cent of his match fee while his
players have each received five per cent fines."


The match at Kensington Oval ended in a thrilling one-wicket win
for England in what was Lara's last international before
retirement.
