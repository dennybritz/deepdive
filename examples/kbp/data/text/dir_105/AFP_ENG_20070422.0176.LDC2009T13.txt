China's banking regulator urged commercial banks Sunday to
implement the central government's macro-control measures after
the economy boomed at an 11.1 percent clip in the first quarter
of 2007.


In a statement on the website of the China Banking Regulatory
Commission (CBRC), chairman Liu Mingkang urged commercial banks
to be cautious in issuing credit and step up risk management.


"All commercial banks must ... scientifically handle the rate of
issuing credit, improve the credit structure and raise the macro
adjustment function of the banking industry," Liu said.


He also called on the banks to maintain capital adequacy ratios
and lower their ratio of non-performing loans, while ensuring the
credit-worthiness of new loans.


China's economic growth accelerated to 11.1 percent year-on-year
in the first quarter of the year, stoking fears of overheating in
an economy that has boomed on excessive liquidity and robust
growth in fixed assets investment.


The government has also expressed fears of inflation with the
consumer price index surging 3.3 percent in March, above the
government-set inflation target of three percent for the year.


Rapid economic growth and rising inflationary pressures are also
stoking concerns that the government will take new steps --
possibly including an interest rate hike -- to tame the country's
sizzling economic expansion.
