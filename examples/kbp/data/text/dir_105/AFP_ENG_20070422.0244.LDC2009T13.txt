Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho took a cheeky swipe at title rivals
Manchester United by claiming it is "forbidden" to give penalties
against the Premiership leaders.


Middlesbrough were denied a certain penalty in the closing stages
of their 1-1 draw at United on Saturday when John O'Shea mistimed
a tackle on South Korean striker Lee Dong-Gook.


Just five days earlier, Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock was
furious when no penalty was given after Luton Shelton was brought
down by Gabriel Heinze in the area during his side's 2-0 defeat.


Mourinho claimed those decisions had effectively given United
extra points and he told Sky Sports News: "Sometimes, when you
watch the last two Manchester United matches, we are a little bit
afraid because it looks like there is a rule in football that it
is forbidden to give a penalty against Manchester United.


"At the moment we should be three points behind them and instead
we are four (points behind)."
