Around 22 million of the European Union's 75 million children are
overweight and 5.1 million are obese, delegates told a conference
that started here on Sunday.


"It's an extraordinary figure and there are 300,000 more obese
children each year," Tim Lobstein of the London-based
International Association for the Study of Obesity told a press
briefing at the start of the four-day meeting.


He said the scientific community knows little about preventing
child obesity but added: "we may have focused too much on the
child and not enough on the environment."


One study to be presented at the conference, which will bring
together some 2,500 European obesity specialists, found that a
programme developed by Paul Sacher of the University College
London led to significant improvements in overweight and obese
children over a period of one year.


Sacher developed the nine-week multi-disciplinary programme,
combining exercise, nutrition and empowerment, to fight excess
weight and obesity, which affects one in three children in the
United Kingdom.


Scientists also said that a lack of specialisation among doctors
made it more difficult to treat obese children in Europe.
