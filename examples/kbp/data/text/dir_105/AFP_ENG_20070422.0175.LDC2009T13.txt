Svetlana Kuznetsova fired Russia into the Fed Cup semi-finals
after beating Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain here on Sunday to
give the hosts an unassailable 3-0 lead.


The 21-year-old clinched her third win in as many meetings over
Medina Garrigues 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 in one hour 42 minutes.


"I played at my top level in the first set but in the second I
suddenly felt giddy and could hardly understand what was
happening on court," Kuznetsova said after the match.


"Luckily I managed to find my concentration in the third. It's
always hard to play against someone who is suffering an injury,
but I managed to win the third set and the match."


"We are in the sem-finals and this is the only thing that
matters."


Kuznetsova, currently fifth in WTA rankings, looked confident
right from the start, breaking her rival's serve midway through
the opening before serving it out after 27 minutes on court.


In the second Medina Garrigues, 24, hit back, breaking early for
a 3-0 lead, while Kuznetsova suddenly lost her nerve, producing a
catalogue of errors.


Kuznetsova, spurred by the home crowd, managed to break back in
the ninth game but Medina Garrigues broke again to level at one
set all after one hour 11 minutes on court.


But in the third Kuznetsova was in command again, taking the set
to love and the match. Medina Garrigues, suffering a back injury
which forced her to take a medical break, failed to resist the
power and prescision of her opponent.


On Saturday Kuznetsova and Nadia Petrova gave Russia a commanding
2-0 lead, beating Lourdes Dominguez-Lino 6-3, 6-2 and Medina
Garrigues 6-3, 6-4 respectively.
