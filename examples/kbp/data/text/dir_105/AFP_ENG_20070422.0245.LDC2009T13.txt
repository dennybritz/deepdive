A Libyan court is to hear final evidence next Sunday in the
slander trial of six foreign medics already on death row for
allegedly injecting more than 400 Libyan children with HIV-
tainted blood, the presiding judge announced.


Salem al-Hamri accepted a defence request for a week's
adjournment to study court papers in more detail at a new hearing
in the Libyan capital on Sunday.


Defence lawyers had expressed concern that a third police officer
would join the existing plaintiffs in accusing the five Bulgarian
nurses and one Palestinian doctor of defamation over allegations
that their confessions were extracted through torture.


But in the event no new plaintiffs emerged at Sunday's hearing.


The six medics have been in custody for eight years and were
condemned to death in 2004.


The accused said their "confessions" in the HIV trial were forced
from them under torture, including beatings, electric shocks and
being threatened with dogs.


The slander charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in
prison. The nurses are Kristiana Valcheva, Nassia Nenova, Valia
Cherveniachka, Valentina Siropoulo and Snejana Dimitrova, and the
doctor is Ashraf Ahmad Juma.


The medics, largely viewed as scapegoats by the international
community, maintain their innocence based on testimony by foreign
health experts who said the AIDS epidemic in Libya's second city
of Benghazi was sparked by poor hygiene.


The six launched a last appeal against their death sentences on
February 17.


EU parliament president Hans-Gert Poettering called on the Libyan
authorities on Friday to free the medics.
