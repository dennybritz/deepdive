Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"There was a decline and unfortunately we haven't been able to
stop that. That has been the most disappointing thing. If there's
one thing that I have great hope for it is to see this West
Indies team get back to the top. You try your best, but sometimes
your best is not enough."


- Brian Lara on hie regrets at retirement


"The prospects of the semi-finals are mouth-watering but less so
is the criticism of the tournament, some of which has been over
the top, to put it mildly."


- ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed hits back the critics of the
World Cup.


"It might quieten a few people down, particularly back at home,
that have been casting all these doubts around about Shane Watson
and his value to this team."


- Australia captain Ricky Ponting defending the selection of the
injury-prone all-rounder.


"There's no replacing hard work."


- Australia opener Matthew Hayden on his simple recipe for
success.


"It's disgusting. I have to pay 100 dollars for a photograph with
Sobers who I have had adored since my childhood."


- Cricket fan Surbeet Singh complaining about the prices being
charged by some ex-players for pictures and autographs.
