Italian Andrea Dovizioso, riding a Honda, won the 250cc Turkish
Grand Prix here Sunday finishing ahead of Spanish pair Jorge
Lorenzo and Alvaro Bautista.


It was the first time that reigning champion Lorenzo has been
beaten this season, following his wins in Qatar and Jerez.


And it was a momentary lapse that cost him as he was overtaken on
the final lap having led since the seventh.


Dovizioso started on pole and was in a battle with the two
Spaniards throughout the entire race.
