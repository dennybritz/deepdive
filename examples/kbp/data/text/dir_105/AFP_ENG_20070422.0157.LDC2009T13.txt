A Muslim man was killed and his wife seriously injured Sunday in
a drive-by shooting by suspected separatist rebels in Thailand's
insurgency-hit south, police said.


The couple were attacked as they rode a motorcycle in Pattani,
one of three Muslim-majority provinces bordering Malaysia where
more than 2,100 people have been killed in separatist violence
since January 2004.


The 47-year-old man died on the way to hospital. His wife remains
in a critical condition.


Violence in the south, once an independent sultanate, has
escalated in the last six months despite peace-building efforts
by the new government, which came to power after a coup last
September.
