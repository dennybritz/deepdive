Chelsea and England captain John Terry insists he would never
play for a club outside the Premiership.


The 26-year-old's future at Stamford Bridge remains uncertain
after he admitted recently that talks over a new contract had
broken down.


Terry, whose present deal with the Premiership champions expires
in 2010, would be a target for Europe's biggest clubs.


But he has given no indication that he wants to leave and claims
a move to Italy or Spain does not appeal after speaking to his
former Chelsea team-mate Eidur Gudjohnen about life at Barcelona.


"Abroad? No, that doesn't appeal to me at all," he told the News
of the World. "It's not what I'm about.


"I'm English through and through, the old English style centre-
half. I still speak to Eidur Gudjohnsen at Barcelona and he says
the training over there is quite relaxed.


"I couldn't settle in that environment. I couldn't let that
happen. I want to go into training knowing I'm going to get
kicked.


"I want to know players are going to kick each other because they
want to win a five-a-side game.


"I speak to foreign players and they say they pull out of tackles
in training. That's not me. Some of the tackles that go in
Chelsea - you'd cringe really."
