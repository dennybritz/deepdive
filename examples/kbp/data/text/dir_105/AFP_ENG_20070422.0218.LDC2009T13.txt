Defending champions Italy swept into the semi-finals of the Fed
Cup after Tathiana Garbin fought back from a set down to beat
China's Shuai Zhang 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the first of Sunday's
singles rubbers.


The World Group quarter-final victory gave the Italians a 3-0
winning lead and set up a last four clash in July against France,
who held an unassailable 3-0 lead over Japan.


Zhang, standing in for Shuai Peng who was forced to quit
Saturday's match against Flavia Pennetta due to injury, started
brightly before Garbin's class eventually told.
