Teenager Tatiana Golovin brushed aside veteran Japanese Ai
Sugiyama 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 love to give France an unassailable 3-0
lead in the Fed Cup here on Sunday.


The two-time Fed Cup champions moved into the semi-finals of the
competition - where they will meet Italy, who beat China - after
a perfect sweep of the first three ties against their overmatched
opponents.


Golovin's play made light of the absence of world number three
Amelie Mauresmo.


Much like her previous day's match against Nathalie Dechy,
Sugiyama fought tooth and nail in the first set, which lasted 1hr
13min, but then crumbled in the second.


The 19-year-old, Moscow-born Golovin, completed her second
victory of the tie, having already defeated Akiko Morigami on
Saturday.


France captain Georges Goven could not hide his delight after the
victory.


"We have what it takes to go all the way. We have the players,
the team spirit and the talent which means they can raise their
level to top."
