Some 2,000 Russians gathered in Moscow's Red Square Sunday in
front of Lenin's mausoleum to mark the 137th anniversary of the
birth of the leader of the Russian revolution, the Ria-Novosti
reported.


NTV television showed children, elderly people and a handful of
communist party deputies queueing to pay homage to the Bolshevik
leader. Ria-Novosti put the turnout at some 2,000.


Some of the children wore the red scarves of the Soviet-era
pioneer movement, while others carried red flags and carnations.
