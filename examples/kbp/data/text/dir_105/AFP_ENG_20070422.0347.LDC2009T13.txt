Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said on Sunday he will
visit Iran this week to urge it to send representatives to an
international conference on Iraq scheduled for next month in
Egypt.


Zebari said he also plans to visit Turkey and may later travel to
Syria. "I can confirm that I have plans to visit Iran this week,
even Turkey and very likely even to Syria," he told AFP.


"The Iraqi government believes that their participation is
crucial for the success of this meeting and for Iraq," he said.


Tehran has still to confirm its attendance at the conference of
ministers from the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, the Group of Eight and Iraq's neighbours in
Sharm el-Sheikh on May 3 and 4.


The meeting will aim to try to find ways to end Iraq's bloodshed
by mobilising foreign powers in support of Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki's government and by isolating extremist factions.


Iran -- which the United States accuses of sponsoring violent
factions fighting in its neighbour -- has demanded the release of
five Iranian officials held in Iraq by US forces on suspicion of
weapons smuggling.


"We will discuss all issues with Iran in an open and honest
manner," Zebari said when asked about Tehran's demand.


"I will try to explain them the significance of this meeting. It
is important to Iran also as much as for Iraq," Zebari added.


The five detained Iranians are also suspected of helping the
anti-American insurgency, the US military says.


Separately, Maliki travelled to Cairo on Sunday and met President
Hosni Mubarak to discuss preparations for the meeting. He will
also meet officials in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
