Huddersfield crushed Harlequins 46-16 on Sunday to record their
fourth successive Super League victory.


Jon Sharp's side were always in control after Jamahl Lolesi
opened the scoring and are beginning to climb up the table.


Chad Randall and Tyrone Smith kept Quins in with a chance, but
the Giants romped home thanks to two tries each from Paul Reilly
and Steve Snitch. Chris Thorman kicked seven goals to reach 1000
points in his career.


"It is about trust. The players trusting the coach and the coach
trusting the players in that what we are doing is right," said
Sharp.


"The result means a lot. We have achieved a lot that we can be
proud of in the last three years."


Salford won 28-24 at Hull KR to boost their chances of climbing
off the bottom of the table.


The visitors took a 16-0 lead through John Wilshere, Luke Dorn
and Aaron Moule. Salford were made to sweat as Jim Gannon, Mark
O'Neill and debutant Mark Lennon scored for Rovers, before Luke
Robinson's try put his team back in pole position.


Rovers got within two points in the final stages but David
Hodgson sealed a much-needed win.
