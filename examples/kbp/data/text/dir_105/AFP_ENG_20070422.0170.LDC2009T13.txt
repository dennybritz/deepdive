Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday urged young people to read his new
book "Jesus of Nazareth" while acknowledging that it is a
challenging read.


The book, which went on sale in Italy on the pope's 80th birthday
last Monday, is "a bit demanding for the youngest," he said after
celebrating mass in the northern Italian town of Pavia, while
adding that he wrote it to help "new generations along the path
of faith."


Sales have been brisk, with 50,000 copies of the 350,000-strong
print run snapped up on the first day, and its publisher Rizzoli
is already planning a second edition of 70,000.


"Jesus of Nazareth," seen as Benedict's answer to popular
publications such as Dan Brown's best-selling "The Da Vinci
Code," aims to reconcile the historical figure of Christ with
that of the Gospels.


The book is being translated into 17 languages, and will soon be
available in Latin America, where books by Spanish Jesuit and
liberation theologian Jon Sobrino were recently severely
criticised by the Vatican.


In his work, Benedict laments "the worst books, which destroy the
figure of Jesus and dismantle faith, filled with the supposed
results" of scriptural study.


This has been taken by many observers as a clear allusion to "The
Da Vinci Code," which was criticised by the Roman Catholic
Church.


Benedict received a warm welcome in Pavia, where he was to kneel
at the tomb of fifth-century Church father Saint Augustine.
