Eight Ethiopians who were kidnapped last month together with five
Europeans who were released after ten days have now also been set
free, the Ethiopian ministry of information said Sunday.


"They have been released today (Sunday). They are still in the
border area between Eritrea and Ethiopia," ministry spokesman
Zemedkum Tekle told AFP.


On March 1, three British men, a French woman and a British-
Italian woman -- all linked to the British embassy in Addis Ababa
-- were abducted with their Ethiopian drivers and translators
during a tourist trip in the arid northeast Afar region.


The five Europeans were released on March 13, but the Ethiopians
remained in captivity.


The Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF), an anti-
government rebel group, claimed the kidnappings.
