Around 180 graves, a quarter of them Jewish, were desecrated in
the early hours of Sunday in a cemetery in the northern French
coastal city of Le Havre, the regional prosecutor said.


Police had arrested, and were questioning, five young people, the
attorney- general's office in the neighbouring regional capital
Rouen said in a statement.


They were to be charged later, it said.


Earlier on Sunday, two men and a youth confessed to desecrating
the gravestones of French Muslim soldiers in a military cemetery
in Arras in northeastern France on Thursday.
