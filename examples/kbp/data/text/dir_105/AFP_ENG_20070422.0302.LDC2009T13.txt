Madonna and the Malawian baby boy she is trying to adopt flew out
of Lilongwe on Sunday bound for London after a six-day visit
which saw her tour orphanages that she is helping fund.


The US pop star's private jet, parked far away from the main
terminal of Kamuzu International Airport, took off at 2.25 pm for
London.


Holding one-year-old David Banda and accompanied by her
biological daughter, Madonna arrived at the airport with her
entourage in two vehicles before getting in the plane.


The singer is in the process of adopting David and was awarded
interim custody in October. It was the first time that she and
the youngster had been back to Malawi.
