Rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy told cheering supporters on Sunday he
wanted to rally the French people behind a "new dream" after
making it through to a runoff vote for the French presidency on
May 6.


"My dear compatriots, I want only one thing: to gather the French
people around a new French dream," he told supporters at his UMP
party headquarters in Paris after topping Sunday's first round
vote.


France must now choose between two visions of society in the
second round, in which he will face the Socialist Segolene Royal,
Sarkozy said.
