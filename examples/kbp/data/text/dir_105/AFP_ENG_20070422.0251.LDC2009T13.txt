Unidentified gunmen dragged 21 members of northern Iraq's Yezidi
religious minority from a bus on Sunday and shot them dead by the
roadside, said police Brigadier General Mohammed El-Waqa'a.


"Workers were travelling back from a textile plant in Mosul to
their home in Bashika, east of the city," he said. "Several
gunmen stopped the buses, chose the Yezidi among the passengers
and killed them in front of everybody."
