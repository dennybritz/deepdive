Britain's finance ministry was set to announce studies on Monday
to analyse the feasibility of the government becoming more
involved in Islamic finance.


In an effort by the government to "promote new ways for British
Muslims to bank, save and borrow using Islamic finance products,"
Economic Secretary Ed Balls will call for a report on the
feasibility of the government issuing a Shariah- compliant
government bond.


"The Islamic finance market is growing globally year on year, and
we want London to play a key role in this area," Balls was due to
say.


Islamic financial products, such as sukuks -- Islamic bonds --
conform to the religion's prohibition of paying interest and
investment in businesses linked to the alcoholic drinks and
gambling sectors.


The report, which will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the
government issuing Islamic financial products in the British
market, is expected to be ready for the pre-budget report later
this year.


"I believe there are great potential advantages for the UK
government issuing Shariah compliant government debt," Balls is
to say.


Balls has also asked National Savings and Investments -- an
executive agency of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance
minister -- to investigate the feasibility of the government
issuing Islamic financial products to retail investors.
