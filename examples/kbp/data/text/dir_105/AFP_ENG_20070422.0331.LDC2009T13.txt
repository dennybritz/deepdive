Insurgents killed three more US soldiers and another soldier died
in and around the Iraqi capital, taking to 59 the military's
losses for this month alone, the military reported on Sunday.


The three were attacked and killed on Saturday, while a fourth
soldier died "due to a non-battle-related cause" in Baghdad on
the same day.


One soldier died and another was wounded when their combat patrol
was attacked with small arms fire in an eastern sector of
Baghdad.


Another soldier was killed and three more wounded when their
vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb and small arms fire in the
southwest of the capital.


The third soldier was killed by indirect fire on a forward
operating base southwest of Baghdad, the military said, adding
that two others were wounded.


The latest deaths brought to 3,319 the military's losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion, according to an AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.
