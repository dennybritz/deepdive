The secretary general of the Organisation of the Islamic
Conference condemned on Sunday the gruesome murder of three
Christians in Turkey, saying Islam bans wanton killing.


"Islam, a religion of peace, tolerance and coexistence --
especially among adherents of Islam, Christianity and Judaism --
prohibits the wanton killing of human beings," Ekmeleddin (eds:
correct) Ihsanoglu, himself a Turk, said in a statement.


Ihsanoglu said that while the "savage murders" were an internal
Turkish affair, he felt compelled to strongly condemn "these
grisly crimes because their perpetrators linked them to Islam."


He said the 57-member Islamic bloc would "pursue its efforts to
promote the culture of diversity and help bolster the policy of
peace, dialogue, centrism and tolerance."


Three Protestants, one of them German, had their throats slit in
a Christian publishing house in the eastern city of Malatya on
Wednesday in the latest attack on minorities in Muslim but
secular Turkey.


The murders followed the killings of a Roman Catholic priest last
year and an ethnic Armenian journalist in January.


Turkish media have speculated that the assailants belong to a
nationalist cell similar to one in the northern city of Trabzon
blamed for the murder of ethnic Armenian journalist Hrant Dink.
