Kenyan Martin Lel won the men's London marathon on Sunday
finishing in 2hrs 7min 41sec to beat Moroccan Abderrahim Goumri
into second with another Kenyan Felix Limo third.


The big surprise, though, was the abandonment of Ethiopian legend
Haile Gebresellasie, the third time he has raced the event.


He was third on his debut in 2002 and ninth last year, when he
described it as the worst race of his life, but was still
expected to challenge Kenyan Paul Tergat for the victory.


But around two thirds of the way through the race, Gebresellasie
called it quits, leaving Tergat to battle it out with last year's
winner Limo and Lel, among others.


With just one kilometre left to race, Lel, Limo and Goumri,
racing in his first marathon, broke away form their three
companions, including Tergat.


Lel had been beaten in a sprint finish last year but left nothing
to chance this time around and ensured he broke clear to snatch
the win.
