Thailand's Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn will meet with
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during a private three-
day visit, the Singapore government said Sunday.


The Singapore leader will host a lunch for the Thai princess when
she attends a science conference that starts on Monday, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.


Her visit comes amid frayed ties between the two Southeast Asian
nations triggered by the sale of telecom giant Shin Corp to
Singapore's state-linked investment firm Temasek Holdings in
2006.


The tax-free deal, which saw the family of then prime minister
Thaksin Shinawatra dispose a 49 percent stake in the Thai telecom
outfit, angered the Thai public and led to protests which sparked
the coup that overthrew Thaksin in September.


Relations further deteriorated when Thaksin was allowed to hold a
private meeting in the city-state in January with Singapore
Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar despite objections from
Thailand.
