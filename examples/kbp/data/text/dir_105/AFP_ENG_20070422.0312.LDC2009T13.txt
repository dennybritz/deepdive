France's Areva Challenge sailed to a second victory in the Louis
Vuitton Cup on Sunday by dominating home hope Desafio Espanol, as
competitors hoisted their sails after a frustrating six days due
to low winds.


Skippered by Sebastien Col, Areva stormed back from a seven-
second deficit at the first buoy in a duel disputed in winds of 7
knots to finish 2min 6sec ahead after the Spanish team suffered
technical problems with their spinnaker boom.


After three races, the French move up to sixth place, equal on
five points with Spain.


The fourth race scheduled later on Sunday between Areva and
Emirates Team New Zealand was however cancelled because of low
winds.


The weather has played havoc with the schedule for the Cup
competition, the winner of which will take on holders Alinghi in
the America's Cup, due off in June.


Organisers have set 7 knots as the minimum for racing. The fourth
and fifth races have now been pushed back until Monday.
