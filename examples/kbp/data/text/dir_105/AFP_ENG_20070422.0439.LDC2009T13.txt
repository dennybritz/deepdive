Rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy told cheering supporters on Sunday he
wanted to rally the French people behind a "new dream" after
making it through to a runoff vote for the presidency on May 6.


"My dear compatriots, I want only one thing: to gather the French
people around a new French dream," he told supporters at his UMP
party headquarters in Paris after topping Sunday's first round
vote.


France must now choose between two visions of society in the
second round, in which he will face the Socialist Segolene Royal,
Sarkozy said.


"By placing me in the lead and Madame Royal in second position,
(voters) clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on
two ideas of the nation, two projects of society, two value
systems," he said.


Sarkozy's dream was one of "a fraternal republic where no-one
will be afraid."


"I want to say to all the French who are afraid, that I want to
protect them against violence, against delinquancy, against
unfair competition (in business), against outsourcing," the
former interior minister said.


Sarkozy, 52, won the first place in the first round election
while Royal, 53, who wants to become France's first woman
president, came in second, projections based on a sample of the
official count showed.
