The biggest umbrella group of local election observers on Sunday
said it was considering rejecting the results of this weekend's
presidential poll in Nigeria and demanding new elections.


"From all the reports we are getting from the field, these were
not credible elections, so it tends to the direction that we will
reject the results and ask for new elections to be held",
Innocent Chukwuma, head of the transition monitoring group (TMG),
told AFP by telephone.


Chukwuma said the TMG would meet later Sunday to take a final
decision on the issue.


Based on reports from 50,000 TMG observers deployed nationwide
during Saturday's presidential poll, Chukwuma said the "elections
did not hold properly in at least 6 states, especially in the
north-east and south-east".


Of the country's 36 states, he cited Anambra, Enugu, Abia,
Adamwa, Gombe and Bauchi.


"And even in the few places where they took place, elections
started very late in the day, some as late as 5.00 or 6.00 pm",
he added.


Results from the showcase election, heralding Nigeria's first
peaceful handover of power from one civilian to another since
independence in 1960, are not expected before Monday.
