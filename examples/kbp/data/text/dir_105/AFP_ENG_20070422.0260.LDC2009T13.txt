Vice president Atiku Abubakar, one of the three leading
contenders in the race for Nigeria's presidency, on Sunday said
the country's presidential and legislative elections must be
cancelled.


"I have already rejected the elections. They have no alternative
other than to cancel them altogether", Abubakar told journalists
in the capital, Abuja, a day after the elections which were
marred by chaos over ballot papers.


"What we have seen clearly proves our fears that it is the worst
election ever seen", he added.
