German rider Stefan Schumacher won the Amstel Gold classic
cycling race here on Sunday, a 252 kilometres ride from
Maastricht.


The 25-year-old Gerolsteiner rider crossed the line several
seconds ahead of a small group which included Italians Davide
Rebellin and Danilo Di Luca to claim his first classic victory.


German Matthias Kessler, winner of a stage of the Tour de France
here last July, placed fourth ahead of Dutch rider and soon to be
retired Michael Boogerd, Spaniard Alejandro Valverde and world
champion Paolo Bettini of Italy.


"It's incredible!" said Schumacher, who only returned to the
saddle last Wednesday after a bad fall during the Tour of the
Basque Country left him with twelve stitches in his left knee.


"With Rebellin we were two riders from the same team in the
leading group so it was only natural that I attacked. It was an
ideal situation.


"I picked the right moment to make the break."


Schumacher has already notched up several successes between the
Tour of Benelux, the Tour of Poland last year and two stage wins
in the Tour of Italy.


Last year's winner Frank Schleck of Luxembourg lost ground after
suffering a fall after 50km.
