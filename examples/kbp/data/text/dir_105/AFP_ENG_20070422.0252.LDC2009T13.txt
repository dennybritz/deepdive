Birmingham moved closer to a quick return to the Premiership on
Sunday after a dramatic 3-2 victory against Wolverhampton.


Steve Bruce's side went top of the Championship thanks to Cameron
Jerome's winner just two minutes from full-time at Molineux.


Birmingham, who are two points clear of third-placed Derby, can
clinch promotion to the Premiership, just a season after they
were relegated from English football's top division, by winning
their final two matches.


Former Manchester United striker Andy Cole put Birmingham ahead
in the 54th minute, but Michael McIndoe equalised for the hosts
in the 67th minute.


McIndoe gave play-off chasing Wolverhampton the lead four minutes
later, but Birmingham drew level through Nicklas Bendtner, on
loan from Arsenal, in the 77th minute.


Jerome's late goal gave Birmingham the advantage but Colin Doyle
had to save a McIndoe penalty in stoppage time to clinch the
points.


Ipswich defender David Wright scored a second half equaliser to
give his side a 1-1 draw at local rivals Norwich. The hosts had
taken the lead through Dickson Etuhu.
