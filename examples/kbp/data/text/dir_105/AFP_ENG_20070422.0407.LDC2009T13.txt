The weekend's presidential poll in Nigeria fell below the
standards set in 2003 and in 1999, the US International
Republican Institute (IRI) said Sunday here.


"Until now, today, yes, it is logistically below the standards
set by Nigeria in 2003 and 1999", Pierre-Richard Prosper, head of
the IRI observer team, told AFP.
