Three hours before polling closed, three-quarters of French
voters had cast first-round ballots in presidential elections, a
giant leap in turnout compared to the 2002 vote, officials said.


Turnout appeared on course to set a record, according to polling
firms IPSOS and IFOP, who predicted it would reach 87 percent the
close of polls at 8:00 pm (1800 GMT).


By 1500 GMT, the interior ministry put turnout at 74 percent,
already exceeding the total participation five years ago.


In 2002, more than half the electorate either abstained or voted
for the extreme left and right candidates, allowing veteran far-
right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen to qualify for the second round
against Jacques Chirac.


Around 44.5 million registered voters -- an increase of 3.4
million on 2002 -- were eligible Sunday to choose a successor to
Chirac, 74, who steps down next month after leading the country
for 12 years.


The highest turnout in a French presidential election, at 84.6
percent, was in 1965 for the election of Charles de Gaulle -- the
first time the country elected a head of state by universal
suffrage.
