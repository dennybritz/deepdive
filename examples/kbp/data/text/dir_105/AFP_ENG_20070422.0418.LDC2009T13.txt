A Commonwealth observer team Sunday said there were "significant
shortcomings" in the conduct of Nigeria's presidential election.


Some voting stations opened several hours late while others
closed ahead of schedule, the observers said, noting that this
"variation in polling hours also adversely affected the voter
turnout."


The Commonwealth team, in a statement, also criticised the lack
of secrecy in the voting.


The team, which deployed 17 observers in 10 of Nigeria's 36
states, said it witnessed one case of ballot box stuffing and one
case of pre-marked ballot papers.


Problems also occurred once the vote was over and counting
started, the team said, noting that polling officials in some
areas had no results sheets, insufficient lighting and that
counting was done at collation centres.


"The deferred polling hours posed a challenge ... in so far as
the count was concerned. Darkness fell while counting was still
in progress and no provision had been made to provide artificial
lighting for such a contingency," the statement continued.


Team leader Joseph Warioba, asked whether he would nevertheless
call the elections gobally free and fair, refused to answer.


The first official results were due on Monday.
