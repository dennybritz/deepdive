Japan's ruling and opposition camps shared one win each in two
upper-house by- elections Sunday, in a test of Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe ahead of national polls in July, public broadcaster
NHK reported.


Teruhiko Mashiko, jointly backed by the main opposition
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and a minor opposition group, had
won enough votes to secure victory against Abe's ruling coalition
candidate and a communist candidate in rural Fukushima, Japanese
news agencies said.


In the remote island chain of Okinawa, a candidate from the
coalition led by Abe's Liberal Democratic Party narrowly beat a
rival from a DPJ-led alliance, NHK said after 10 percent of votes
were counted.


Aiko Shimajiri, a 42-year-old former municipal assembly woman,
was certain to win in Okinawa after collecting 26,987 votes
against 23,660 for opposition candidate Yoshimasa Karimata. A
third candidate, an independent, garnered 381 votes.


The by-elections were held along with local elections in most of
Japan's 47 prefectures to elect mayors and chiefs in 77 cities,
96 towns and villages and 13 wards in Tokyo. Seats in about 780
local assemblies were also contested.


The poll results could set the tone for July's national
elections, in which Abe's ruling coalition, which includes the
Buddhist-backed New Komeito, defends its slim majority in the
House of Councillors, the upper chamber of parliament.
