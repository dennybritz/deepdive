The wail of sirens sounded across Israel on Sunday evening,
marking the start of Memorial Day for the fallen in its eight
wars and for the victims of militant attacks.


Speaking at the central ceremony at Ammunition Hill -- site of
one of the deadliest battles of the 1967 Middle East war -- Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert vowed to make every effort to bring peace
between Israel and the Arab world.


"We are aware of what is occurring across our borders, and hear
also the strengthening of moderate voices," he said.


"Our duty to the fallen, to the families and to all the citizens
of Israel, is to make every possible effort to pave the long road
which leads to the prevention of war and to peace."


Olmert payed tribute to the 233 Israeli soldiers and civilians
who have been killed over the past year, including more than 160
who died in the month-long war in Lebanon last summer which
Olmert ordered after Shiite militants of Hezbollah captured two
Israeli soldiers in a deadly cross-border raid.
