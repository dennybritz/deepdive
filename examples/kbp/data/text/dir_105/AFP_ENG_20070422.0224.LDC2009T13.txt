An elderly Saudi man dropped dead in court after it banned him
from stopping his three daughters from getting married,
newspapers reported on Sunday.


The man apparently had a heart attack once the cassation court
judge in the Muslim holy city of Mecca told the three women, aged
36, 39 and 40, that they could marry over their father's
objections, Okaz reported.


The man had won a ruling from a lower court enforcing his right
to prevent his daughters from marrying, as women in the ultra-
conservative kingdom need the consent of a male guardian.


The women whose father had on several occasions turned down their
requests to marry can now marry "honest men" who follow their
religious duties, the Islamic court ruled, according to Al-Madina
newspaper.


In July 2002, a local social study found that the number of
unmarried women in Saudi Arabia was expected to jump to four
million in 2007, compared to 1.5 million in 2002.


Large dowries demanded by fathers are believed to be a major
cause for the increasing number of unmarried women in the Gulf
state, where Saudi nationals account for some 17 million out of a
total population of around 22 million.
