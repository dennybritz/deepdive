A Turkish soldier has been killed in a clash with separatist
rebels from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in
southeast Turkey, officials said Sunday.


The clash occurred in a mountainous area in Bingol province, the
governor's office said in a statement, without specifying when it
took place.


Another soldier was injured in the same area when he stepped on a
landmine, believed to have been planted by the PKK.


The army said earlier this month that it had launched "large-
scale" operations against the PKK with the arrival of spring,
when the rebels step up attacks as snow melts in the mountains,
facilitating their movement.


The PKK, listed as a terrorist group by Ankara and much of the
international community, took up arms for self-rule in the
Kurdish-majority southeast in 1984. The conflict has claimed more
than 37,000 lives.
