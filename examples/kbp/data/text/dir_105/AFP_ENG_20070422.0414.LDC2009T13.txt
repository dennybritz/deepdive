Pop stars Beyonce and Shakira rose to the top spot of the British
singles charts on Sunday with their duet "Beautiful Liar".


The song, which was in the fifth spot last week, unseated
Timbaland's "Give It To Me," which dropped to third.


Arctic Monkeys took the second spot with their song "Brainstorm,"
which rose nine positions from last week, ahead of the Monday
release of their hotly- anticipated second album "Favourite Worst
Nightmare."


Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend" held steady at fourth,  while Mark
Ronson's "Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before" fell
from second last week to fifth this week.


Lavigne managed to top the album charts with "The Best Damn
Thing," followed by Ronson's album "Version."
