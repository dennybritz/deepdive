China's Ding Junhui is on the verge of elimination from the World
Snooker Championship after Ronnie O'Sullivan cruised to an 8-1
lead in their first round match here on Sunday.


Ding, 20, was given a lesson in snooker's fine arts by two-time
world champion O'Sullivan at the Crucible Theatre.


The Chinese prodigy looks certain to go out when they resume on
Monday as O'Sullivan needs just two more frames to win.


O'Sullivan, nicknamed 'The Rocket', recorded seven breaks over 50
including a 109 in the third frame. Ding had few chances to
establish any momentum, although he managed a 103 in the sixth
frame.


Ding's last chance of clawing his way back into the match may
have gone when he missed a series of opportunities to win the
seventh frame.
