Insurgents killed four more US soldiers and another soldier died
in and around the Iraqi capital, taking to 60 the military's
losses for this month alone, the military reported on Sunday.


The four were attacked and killed on Saturday, while a fifth
soldier died "due to a non-battle-related cause" in Baghdad on
the same day.


One soldier was killed and three others were wounded when their
combat patrol was attacked with small arms fire and rocket-
propelled grenades in west Baghdad.


Another combat patrol was attacked with small arms fire which
killed one soldier and wounded another in an eastern sector of
Baghdad.


A soldier was killed and three more were wounded when their
vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb and small arms fire in the
southwest of the capital.


And a soldier was also killed by indirect fire on a forward
operating base southwest of Baghdad, the military said, adding
that two others were wounded.


The latest deaths brought to 3,320 the American military's losses
in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion, according to an AFP count
based on Pentagon figures.
