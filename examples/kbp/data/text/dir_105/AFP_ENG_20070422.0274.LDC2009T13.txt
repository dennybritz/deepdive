Senegal's armed forces minister, also mayor of the southern city
of Kolda, is to meet with residents Sunday, after clashes there
with police the previous night left one youth dead.


Violence broke out late Saturday after the funeral of 23-year-old
Dominique Lopy, who died in police custody last weekend. Lopy had
been picked up on suspicion of stealing from an official.


Authorities said that Becaye Diop was travelling down from the
capital Brazzaville to meet neighbourhood leader Solo Diane, who
has called a community meeting later Sunday to try to defuse the
crisis.


Several residents told AFP they blamed Lopy's death on injuries
he had received while in custody.


One of two civilians injured in the clashes died late Saturday,
while the second was still in intensive care Sunday.


Three police officers were injured when their vehicle overturned
while they were chasing the protestors. Local police chiefs
refused to comment on Saturday's clashes.


In the central district of Doumassou, where both Lopy and the
latest victim of the violence lived, the streets were quiet
Sunday but the atmosphere remained tense, an AFP correspondent
reported.


It is the second time that local youths have clashed with police
over this issue. There were clashes on April 14, just after
Kopy's death was announced.


His family said they had not released the autopsy report on his
death for what they said were security reasons.
