Rightwinger Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Segolene Royal will
contest a runoff after winning most votes in the first round of
France's presidential election on Sunday, according to
projections from four polling firms.


Sarkozy, the 52-year-old former interior minister, won the first
place in the election while Royal, 53, who wants to become
France's first woman president, came in second, projections based
on a sample of the official count showed.


The second round is set for May 6.
