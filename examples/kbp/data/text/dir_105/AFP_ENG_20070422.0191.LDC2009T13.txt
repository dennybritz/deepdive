Police fired tear gas and used batons as violence erupted in a
Pakistani town Sunday over the blowing up of a pro-Taliban
group's headquarters, security officials said.


Police also resorted to aerial firing to quell hundreds of
protesters who attacked shops and torched at least five police
checkposts in Bara town, which borders Afghanistan, a security
official said.


At least five people were injured including a policeman, he said.


The hardline group Lashkar-i-Islami (Army of Islam) called the
protest after the authorities blew up its headquarters in Bara on
Thursday. The group had refused demands to close it down.


Officials said Lashkar's commander had set up a Taliban-style
court in the building and kept a prison in the basement.


The group was also behind the stoning and shooting to death of a
woman and two men accused of adultery.


The situation was tense and police and paramilitary troops were
patrolling in the area, officials said.


Last year, 25 people died in battles in Bara between supporters
of mullahs who used illegal radio stations to preach rival
versions of Islam.


Pakistan has been fighting so-called "Talibanisation" in its
conservative tribal belt since thousands of militants fled
Afghanistan in late 2001 after US-led forces toppled the hardline
Islamic regime there.
