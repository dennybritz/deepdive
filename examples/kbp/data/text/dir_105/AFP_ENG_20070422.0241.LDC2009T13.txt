A Yemeni appeal court upheld Sunday sentences of 40 months jail
each for 19 nationals who forged documents in attempt to get to
Iraq to join the insurgency there.


Two of an original 23 men charged were acquitted while the
sentences of two others were commuted last July by a lower court
which ordered their release.


Most of the accused were arrested in Syria before reaching Iraq,
and were each sentenced to three years and four months in prison.


They were found guilty of falsifying documents to enable them to
get to Iraq, possession of arms and of helping suspects of the
Al-Qaeda terror network to hide.


Yemen is the ancestral homeland of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden.


Since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Sanaa
has worked with Washington to clamp down on suspected Al-Qaeda
sympathisers.
