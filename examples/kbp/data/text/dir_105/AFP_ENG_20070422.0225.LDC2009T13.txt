Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki met Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Sunday to discuss preparations for next month's
international conference on Iraq.


Ministers from the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, the Group of Eight and Iraq's neighbours are
set to meet in Sharm el- Sheikh on May 3-4 to try to find ways to
end Iraq's bloodshed.


Maliki spoke with Mubarak and Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif
on bilateral relations and how Egypt can contribute to the search
for stability in war-torn Iraq.


After the regional security conference, talks will be held on the
UN-backed "International Compact", a framework agreement for
foreign donors to contribute to Iraqi reconstruction and
development projects.


According to an Egyptian diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, the conferences will set out a comprehensive plan for
the next five years on how the international community can
support Iraq's economic recovery which will in turn help with
national reconciliation.


A permanent secretariat of Iraqi and UN officials will be set up
to oversee the implementation of the initiative presented by the
conference, he added.


Maliki is accompanied by Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani,
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rafie al-Issawi and
National Security Advisor Muwaffaq al- Rubaie.


Maliki will go to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia after Egypt, his office
reported.
