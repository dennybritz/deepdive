Three-quarters of French voters had cast ballots in the first
round of the country's presidential election by 1500 GMT, a giant
leap in turnout compared to the 2002 vote, officials said.


Three hours before the close of polls at 8:00 pm (1800 GMT),
turnout was 74 percent, already exceeding the total turnout from
five years ago, according to the interior ministry.
