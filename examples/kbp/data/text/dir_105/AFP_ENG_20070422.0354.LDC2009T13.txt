Spanish police on Sunday said they had seized more than four
tonnes of hashish in a boat at sea and arrested 15 people in the
latest of a series of raids on drug trafficking rings.


In a statement police said 4.3 tonnes of hashish had been seized
in a small boat belonging to one of the suspects.


The 15 people arrested were Spanish, Colombian, Romanian and
Moroccan nationals, police said.


Three of them were crew members, one was the suspected head of a
drug trafficking ring, and eight were suspected of trying to
smuggle the drugs onto the Spanish island of Ibiza in the
Mediterranean Sea.


The investigation began in mid-January after police discovered
trafficking rings in the southeastern Levant area and in
northeastern Catalonia using an ocean rescue boat to carry drugs
from Morocco to Ibiza.


A total of 13,000 euros (18,000 dollars), two kilos (4.4 pounds)
of cocaine, five inflatable boats and 15 mobile phones were also
seized in the police raid, according to the statement.


Spain is Europe's main point of entry for Moroccan cannabis and
for cocaine from South America.
