Manchester United legend Denis Law believes Cristiano Ronaldo is
on course to become the club's greatest ever player.


Law is regarded as one of the finest players ever to pull on a
United shirt and he knows exactly what it takes to become an icon
at Old Trafford after playing alongside George Best and Bobby
Charlton in the 1960s.


But the Scottish striker, who scored 171 goals for United and
helped them win their first European Cup in 1968, is convinced
Ronaldo can maintain the superb form he has shown this season and
become an all-time great.


"The way he's playing, there's every chance he'll become United's
greatest ever player," Law told the Sunday Express.


"It's very difficult to compare him and Bestie in the
circumstances because you're going back many, many years.


"But I suppose if Bestie was playing in the current United team,
then they'd be on a par."


Law claims Portugal winger Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney give United
the potential to emulate the famous feats of Best and company.
"In our team, we had Bobby Charlton and Bestie," he said.


"And you knew that, even if you weren't playing well, Bobby and
Bestie would be able to do something special.


"That's exactly what they've got in the present United team with
Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. They're such a formidable pair."
