In an unprecedented move, some prison inmates in Nigeria were
given authorisation to vote in Saturday's presidential poll, the
official News Agency of Nigeria said Sunday.


Around 150 inmates of Birnin Kebbi prison in northwest Nigeria
were allowed to cast ballots at the Magaji polling station, NAN
said.


Prisoners said that by allowing them to vote, the federal
government had accorded them the same political status and
recognition as other Nigerians.


One, who identified himself simply as Mukhtar, said he would
remain grateful for the opportunity to vote for "my beloved
presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari" of the opposition All
Nigeria Peoples Party.


Buhari, 64, a former Nigerian military head of state, is one of
two main presidential challengers against the ruling People's
Democratic Party candidate, Umaru Yar'Adua, widely favoured to
win in poll.


NAN said the prisoners were brought to the polling station in a
"Black Maria" police vehicle in groups of 50.
