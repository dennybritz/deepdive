Even with ballot-box chaos and violent attacks during Nigeria's
landmark presidential election, the country's two flagship
dailies on Sunday expressed muted support for the poll.


"Despite a logisitical nightmare, low voter turnout, Nigeria
wades through," said the independent daily This Day, commenting
on Saturday's chaotic election for a successor to President
Olusegun Obasanjo.


The poll was marred by a failed bid to blow up the offices of the
country's election commission, shootings, an attack threatening
the life of a leading vice-presidential candidate and voting
delays caused by missing ballot papers and materials.


"Polls Peaceful, Subdued," was the headline of another of the
country's independent papers, The Guardian.


Highlighting low turnout attributed to fears of a replay of the
violence that marred governorship elections a week earlier, the
paper said:    "Yesterday's polling, the last in a transition
programme that will usher in a new civilian government, was a
marked departure from the previous exercise that was flawed in
many respects."


The paper added however that there had been many instances of
snatching of ballot papers and boxes, under-age voting,
intimidation and harassment of voters, often by armed political
thugs.


Opposition dailies such as The Nation and The Sunday Sun were far
less happy.


"Chaotic," screamed the latter. "Long queues, no ballot papers."


Front-paged in The Nation were condemnations, threats to reject
the results and a title reading, "Violence, fraud nationwide."
