Azerbaijan on Sunday cancelled a high-level government
delegation's trip to Washington to protest against a perceived
snub by the US State Department in a human rights report.


The 2006 report initially included a reference to the disputed
province of Nagorny Karabakh as Azerbaijani territory occupied
the country's Caucasus neighbour and bitter enemy Armenia.


This reference was later deleted after diplomatic pressure from
Yerevan.


"In relation to the introduction of changes in the initial 2006
text of a US State Department human rights report relating to the
Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorny Karabakh conflict, the government of
Azerbaijan has taken the decision to cancel the visit,"
Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said in a statement.


"The introduction of corrections, distorting the essence of the
Armenian- Azerbaijani Nagorny Karabakh conflict causes
bewilderment and doubts about the position of the US as an honest
broker in the resolution of the conflict," it said.


A delegation of high-level government officials had been due to
arrive in Washington on Monday for two days of bilateral talks.


Armenian forces seized Nagorny Karabakh from Azerbaijan during a
war in the early 1990s that claimed an estimated 35,000 lives and
forced about one million people on both sides to flee their
homes.


The neighbours signed a ceasefire deal in 1994, but cut direct
economic and transport links and have still not negotiated a
settlement on the status of the enclave.
