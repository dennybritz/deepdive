Zhou Chunxiu made history as the first Chinese runner to win the
London marathon as she came home in 2hrs 20min 38sec on Sunday,
finishing ahead of Ethiopia's Gete Wami and Romanian Constantina
Tomescu-Dita.


Asian Games champion Zhou put in a punishing spurt over the last
three miles of the 26-mile race to blow away the rest of the
field.


Zhou got off to a fast start in unseasonal heat in London but it
was her finish that made the difference.


She finished more than a minute ahead of Wami, the Berlin
marathon winner last year.


Tomescu-Dita, runner-up behind Paula Radcliffe in 2005, passed a
shattered Lornah Kiplagat - one of the pre-race favourites who
was in contention until the latter stages - towards the finish.
