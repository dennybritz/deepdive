World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz has announced the appointment
of Obiageli "Oby" Ezekwesili, formerly education minister in
Nigeria, as vice president of the bank for the African region.


"Oby's life is a testament to her dedication to Africa as is the
high degree of respect in which she is held by the international
community," Wolfowitz said in a statement Friday. "Her passion
for and commitment to Africa, high degree of integrity and
optimism will bring invaluable strengths to our organization."


Ezekwesili was one of the founding members of Transparency
International, an organization dedicated to fighting corruption.


She also served as special assistant to the president of Nigeria
on budget monitoring.


Ezekwesili subsequently served as minister of solid minerals
development, a post where she concentrated on reforming Nigeria's
mining sector to internationally recognized standards.


She was appointed minister of education last June.


"Oby's unique blend of first-hand experiences, especially in the
more challenging and complex areas of energy sector reform and
education, position her as the ideal candidate to serve as the
vice president for Africa," Wolfowitz added.


The World Bank lends about 4.7 billion dollars a year to African
countries.
