Eritrea's Zersenay Tadesse was a surprise winner of the men's
long course race on Sunday at the world cross country
championships.


The 25-year-old Tadesse, the World 20km road race champion took
the race by the scruff of its neck after breaking away from the
defending champion Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia before sprinting
away to win in 35 minutes 50 seconds.


There was a major shock as a tired-looking Kenenisa, who could
only watch the race slip away from his grasp, decided to abandon
a short distance from the finish.


It was the first time that Kenenisa, a ten-times champion has
failed to finish a race.


Kenya's Moses Mosop finished second while his compatriot Bernard
Kipyego took third place.


That ensured Kenya would retain the overall team title followed
by Morocco, Uganda, Eritrea, Qatar and finally Tanzania.
