Spanish champions Barcelona on Saturday expressed their wish on
Saturday that two-time world footballer of the year Ronaldinho be
spared from playing in this summer's Copa America in Venezuela.


Barcelona president Joan Laporta told the Spanish press that he
believed it was better for the player he did not play in the
Copa, which gets underway on June 26.


"It would be better if Ronaldinho didn't play in the Copa
America," said Laporta.


Barcelona are in with a shout of reaching the Spanish Cup final -
they have a two legged semi-final date with Getafe - which is on
June 23 and would like to have Ronaldinho as well as their other
Latin American stars Argentina's Lionel Messi and Javier Saviola
and Rafael Marquez of Mexico available.


According to the Spanish press, Ronaldinho hopes to take an
extended holiday after the season finishes as he feels exhausted
after playing so much over the past two years.


Ronaldinho has apparently even come to an agreement with Brazil
coach, Dunga, and will not be selected, according to Spanish
sports daily Marca.


However this has not been confirmed from the Brazil camp, who are
presently in Sweden preparing for their friendly match against
Chile on Saturday.
