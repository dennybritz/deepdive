Australia opener Matthew Hayden smashed the fastest century in
World Cup history on Saturday.


Hayden reached the landmark in 66 balls in the Group A match
against South Africa at Warner Park here beating the previous
best century of 67 balls set by Canada's John Davison against the
West Indies at Centurion in 2003.


He achieved the record with a six off South African skipper
Graeme Smith.
