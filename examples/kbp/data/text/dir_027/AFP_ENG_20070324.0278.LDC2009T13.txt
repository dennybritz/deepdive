European Union leaders kicked off festivities to mark the 50th
anniversary of the bloc on Saturday with a gala concert at the
Berlin Philharmonic hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.


The concert, conducted by Sir Simon Rattle, will feature
performances of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, whose final chorus
"Ode to Joy" is the EU anthem, as well as regional folk music.
