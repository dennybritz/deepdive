The German presidency of the European Union on Saturday urged
Iran to free 15 British naval personnel seized by its forces in
the Gulf.


"We demand the immediate release of the British soldiers," German
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters ahead of
a meeting of European socialists.


The presidency issued a statement later reiterating the call,
adding that the German ambassador in Tehran had spoken with the
Iranian government about the matter.


The 15 British personnel were seized in the Shatt al-Arab
waterway between Iran and Iraq on Friday as they conducted
"routine" anti-smuggling operations.


The semi-official Fars news agency in Iran said the 15 had been
taken to Tehran for questioning for "failing to respect
international frontiers and for illegally entering Iranian
territorial waters."


Meanwhile in New York the 15 members of the UN Security Council
reached broad agreement late on Friday ahead of a vote Saturday
on an amended draft resolution that would expand UN sanctions
imposed on Iran in December for spurning repeated demands to
freeze its sensitive nuclear fuel work.


Steinmeier added he was "confident" that the security council
would pass a resolution introducing harsher sanctions against
Tehran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment.
