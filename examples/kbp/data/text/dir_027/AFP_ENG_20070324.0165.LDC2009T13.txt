Rain delayed the scheduled 0930am local time (1330GMT) start of
the World Cup Group C match between England and Kenya at the
Beausejour Cricket Ground here Saturday.


Both sides had to win this match to be assured of qualifying,
alongside group winners New Zealand, for the Super Eight second
phase of the World Cup.


Umpire Rudi Koertzen said the earliest possible start would now
be at 11am local time. If the game did start at 11am, the South
African official added the match would be reduced from 50 overs
per side to 46 per side.


Both teams must bat for a minimum of 20 overs to ensure this game
constitutes a match under the Duckworth-Lewis rain ruling. That
would mean there was no need to play on Sunday's reserve day.


Should no play at all be possible on either day, England would go
through because of their superior run-rate.
