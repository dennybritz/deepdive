Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi said Saturday a quick
pullout of the US- led coalition troops would not benefit
Washington until the Iraqi forces are trained enough to replace.


Hashimi also said the Iraqi armed forces will need no more than
one and a half years to prepare for systematic withdraw of the
coalition forces.


"Many of the Democrats are now pushing the White House for a
quick withdraw from Iraq. This is not going to benefit either the
American or Western interest as well as the Iraqi interest," said
the Iraqi politician, who is currently visiting Tokyo.


The security vacuum "could happen immediately after the pullout
of the coalition troops," he told reporters at a news conference.


Hashimi said Iraq's national armed forces are not yet ready to
maintain stability in the war-torn country because of lack of
training and insurgents penetrating the military and police.


Asked how long his country would need for reforming the national
security forces, he said, "Let's say one year, in fact, one year,
one and a half years, not more than that."


The US House of Representatives Friday voted to impose an August
2008 deadline to pull combat troops out of Iraq, prompting a veto
threat and furious rebuke from President George W. Bush.


After winning back control of Congress in an election fueled by
public anxiety over Iraq, the Democrats are eager to ratchet up
the pressure on Bush and to make life difficult for his
Republican allies in Congress who must answer to voters angry
over the war.
