Witnesses in the Sudanese capital reported clashes Saturday
between security forces and members of Darfur's former rebel
Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) that resulted in unspecified
casualties.


Police said they were preparing a statement but initial reports
said a shootout in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman resulted in
policemen and bystanders being shot, with the injured rushed to
hospital.


The SLM of Minni Minnawi launched a revolt against the central
government in Sudan's western Darfur region in 2003, but three
years later signed a peace accord with the government.
