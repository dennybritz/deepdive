Daniel Vancsik moved closer to his maiden European Tour title on
Saturday with a bogey-free third round four-under-par 68 at the
Madeira Island Open.


The Argentine holds a 14-under-par total of 202 for a four
strokes lead over Denmark's Mads Vibe-Hastrup, who shot 68, with
Frenchman Christian Cevaer a further shot back after hitting a
level par 72.


Vancsik did not manage a single top-10 finish in 25 starts in his
first full season in Europe last year.


And if the 30-year-old goes on to win he will join South African
Anton Haig, China's Liang Wen-chong and Thai golfer Chapchai
Nirat in tasting maiden success on the circuit in March.


Vibe-Hastrup is also chasing his first victory.


Spain's Santiago Luna hit 72 to slip into a tie for fourth with
Scot Euan Little on eight under, six behind.


Overnight leader Vancsik was caught early on when Cevaer and Luna
both birdied the long third, but he responded by picking up shots
on the fifth, seventh, 11th and 14th.
