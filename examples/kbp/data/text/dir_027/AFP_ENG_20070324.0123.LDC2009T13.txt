A Sunni insurgent coalition led by Al-Qaeda in Iraq claimed
responsibility on Saturday for a mortar attack on Baghdad's
fortified Green Zone which rattled visiting UN chief Ban Ki-moon.


The Islamic State of Iraq said its militants have fired a
"barrage of 120 mm mortars" while Ban and Iraqi Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki held a press conference on Thursday, the group
said in an Internet statement.


"Allah has enabled us to force fear into the hearts of the
infidels and apostates, and terrorise a key figure in this
infidel (UN) organisation, which fights Islam and Muslims
everywhere," it said.


A mortar round struck a garden about 40 meters (yards) away from
where the press conference was taking place.


The loud blast sent a column of smoke and dust into the sky near
the northern edge of the Green Zone, opposite the Jumhuriyah
Bridge in downtown Baghdad in a heavily policed area near
Maliki's office.


Ban's visit to Iraq, whose relations with the world body are
traditionally troubled, was the first by a UN secretary general
since his predecessor, Kofi Annan, came to Baghdad in November
2005.


A bomb attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad on August 19,
2003 killed 22 people, including UN envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.
