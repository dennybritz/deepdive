About 30 Greek neo-Nazis burned copies of a new history textbook
criticized as biased towards Turks in a protest before the
parliament building Saturday.


Members of the Chryssi Avghi (Golden Dawn) group threw copies of
the burnt books onto the road at the end of a traditional parade
in the capital marking the country's independence day. The
official independence day is Sunday.


Militants yelled anti-Turk slogans and distributed pamphlets
urging resistance to closer ties between Greece and Turkey. Riot
police eventually dispersed them.


Critics of the textbook to be used in middle schools say it
embellishes the Ottoman Empire and underestimates the role of the
Orthodox Church in the Greek battle for independence.


One of the book's editors, Maria Repoussi, said that it avoids
labeling the 400 years of Ottoman domination of Greece as
"slavery." It also breaks with certain interpretations of the
Orthodox Church's role in Greek independence.


Education Minister Marietta Yannakou has ruled out withdrawing
the book. She has asked for an evaluation from the national
education institute that could eventually lead to modifications.
