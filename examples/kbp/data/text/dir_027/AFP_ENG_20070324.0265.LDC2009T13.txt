Northern Ireland's largest Protestant party wants the deadline
for them to agree to form a power-sharing government with their
Catholic rivals put back six weeks, media reports said Saturday.


Britain's Press Association news agency and Sky News television,
said 90 percent of the 120-member executive of the Democratic
Unionists (DUP) meeting in Belfast on Saturday want Prime
Minister Tony Blair to agree to the delay.


The DUP is under pressure to given an answer as to whether it
will share power with the republicans of Sinn Fein by 2300 GMT
Monday or see the devolved assembly in Belfast dissolved
indefinitely.


The London government also wants Ian Paisley's DUP to put forward
its nominations for ministerial posts by 0001 GMT Sunday.


But the Press Association and Sky News both quoted unnamed
sources as saying that members had made an offer of a date in May
for power-sharing -- if Blair was prepared to delay it for six
weeks.


No nominations for ministerial posts, including Paisley as first
minister, would be made on Monday on the understanding that they
would do so in six weeks' time, they added.


The meeting broke up at about 1440 GMT, with Paisley and DUP
officials saying a resolution was passed but that a full
statement would be issued later Saturday.
