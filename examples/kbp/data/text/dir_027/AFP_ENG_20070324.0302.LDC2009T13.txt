Australia opener Matthew Hayden smashed the fastest century in
World Cup history on Saturday.


Hayden reached the landmark in 66 balls in the Group A match
against South Africa at Warner Park here, beating the previous
best century off 67 balls set by Canada's John Davison against
the West Indies at Centurion in 2003.


He achieved the record with a six off South African skipper
Graeme Smith.


"We had the right conditions here for a big total, it's a small
ground and  a very good wicket," said Hayden who was eventallly
dismissed for 101 as Australia piled up 377-6 in their 50 overs,
the third highest World Cup score.


"I was surprised how good a wicket it was."


Hayden hit the first ball of the match for four off Shaun Pollock
and never looked back while he and opening partner Adam Gilchrist
(42 off 42 ball), who feasted on Makhaya Ntini, put on 106 for
the first wicket.


"It was sort of premeditated to some degree, but you still have
to weigh up the conditions. I wasn't sure how the wicket was
going to play, it was pretty true," he said.


"I fancied myself against Pollock and Ntini bowls those great
shapes to Adam."


Hayden was out for 101 off 68 balls when he was caught by
Herschelle Gibbs off Jacques Kallis having clubbed 14 fours and
for sixes.


The 35-year-old Hayden also took his international career one-day
record beyond the 5,000-run mark.
