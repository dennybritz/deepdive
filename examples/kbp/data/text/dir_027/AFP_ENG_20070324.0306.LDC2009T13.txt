German cyclist David Kopp suffered a broken nose and concussion
after a spectacular crash during the Spring classic Milan-San
Remo race here on Saturday.


Kopp, who appeared not to lose consciousness, fell on the descent
from Capo Berta, around 40 kilometres from the finish.


Doctors placed a neck brace on him before taking him to hospital.


His compatriots and fellow Gerolsteiner team-mates Heinrich
Haussler and Fabian Wegmann also came down but were able to
rejoin the race, though, another team- mate Andrea Moletta was
not so fortunate either as he also came a cropper a few
kilometres later.


The Italian broke his femur and is likely to have surgery.
