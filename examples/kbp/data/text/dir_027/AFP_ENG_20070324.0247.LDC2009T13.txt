Home hope Dani Pedrosa grabbed pole position ahead of seven-time
world champion Valentino Rossi of Italy for the Spanish Grand
Prix here on Saturday.


The 21-year-old Honda rider had been trailing Yamaha's Rossi
going into the final lap but timed 1min 39.402sec to edge the
Italian by just 0.051 seconds to claim the fifth pole position of
his career.


Veteran Carlos Checa made it two Spaniards on the front row as he
finished 0.058 off the pace on his Honda, to push Yamaha's Colin
Edwards of the United States into fourth, ahead of championship
leader Casey Stoner of Australia.


World champion Nicky Hayden was 11th fastest on his Repsol Honda.


Pedrosa, three-times world champion in 125cc and twice in 250cc,
was the best debutant last year in MotoGP with two victories in
China and Great Britain.


"It will be a difficult race Sunday, but it's a good thing to be
on the front row," said Pedrosa, who finished second last year
behind Italian Loris Capirossi (Ducati) who was 15th fastest
Saturday.


"I don't really have a strategy, all will depend on the start."


Rossi is bidding for a seventh victory on the Jerez circuit.


"I'm happy because our aim was to be on the front row, even if
I'm disappointed not being on pole," said Rossi.


"I was a bit worried yesterday during the free testing and this
morning we found a good tyre for the race. It will be very
important in the final laps."
