Chinese glamour girl Guo Jingjing was in a class of her own
Saturday as she took the first step to claiming an historic
fourth 3m springboard world title.


The photogenic 25-year-old, whose high-profile reported
relationships in recent years have made her prime gossip-column
fodder in China, showed her class throughout the preliminary
round, leading the field from the first dive.


Guo is the current world and Olympic champion and stunned her
competitors with her second dive, achieving the best score of the
preliminary round, 76.50, with a difficult reverse two-and-a-half
somersault.


Aiming to be the first diver to win a world title four times, she
ended with a score of 356.10, more than 30 points ahead of
second-placed Anna Lindberg of Sweden, ranked three in the world.


But Guo's teammate and her customary strongest rival for the gold
medal, Wu Minxia, struggled to qualify for Sunday's semi-finals.


Wu, who won silver behind Guo at the 2004 Athens Olympics and the
2005 world championships in Montreal, only scored 36.00 on her
last dive, eventually qualifing 13th out of 18 divers.


Australian Sharleen Stratton finished in third. Canada's Blythe
Hartley, a double 1m springboard world champion, was sixth.


China's momentum continued in the men's 10m platform
preliminaries with Zhou Luxin the top qualifier with 537.60
points.


Gleb Galperin of Russia was second, China's Lin Yue third and
Canada's Alexandre Despatie fourth. The final is Sunday.
