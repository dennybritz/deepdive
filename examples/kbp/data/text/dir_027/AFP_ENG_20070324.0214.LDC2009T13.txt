Eritrea's Zersenay Tadesse won the men's cross country title here
on Saturday.


He beat Kenya's Moses Mosop and Bernard Kipyego into second and
third places respectively.


There was a big shock after ten-times cross country champion
Kenenisa Bekele pulled out only a few metres away from the finish
after Tadesse had overtaken him for the lead.
