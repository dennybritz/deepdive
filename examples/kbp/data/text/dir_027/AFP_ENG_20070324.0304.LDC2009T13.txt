European Union leaders kicked off festivities to mark the 50th
anniversary of the bloc Saturday with a gala concert at the
Berlin Philharmonic hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.


The concert, conducted by Britain's Sir Simon Rattle, will
feature performances of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, whose final
chorus "Ode to Joy" is the EU anthem, as well as regional folk
music.


After the concert, German President Horst Koehler will welcome
the leaders and their spouses to a gala dinner at his central
Berlin residence, Bellevue Palace.


The official part of the celebrations, the signing on Sunday of a
Berlin Declaration on the principles and goals uniting the
27-member bloc, will be livened up during the weekend with
cultural events throughout the capital.


Museums will throw open their doors to the public into the wee
hours Sunday while the city's famed discotheques will fire up a
European Club Night.


And a festival at the Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of European
division, then unity after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, will
feature national delicacies from each of the member states and a
rock concert.
