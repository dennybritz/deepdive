Russian forces killed four rebel fighters in a shoot-out in
Chechnya, the Interfax news agency quoted a battalion commander
as saying of the latest clash in the war-ravaged southern Russian
province.


Soldiers from the Vostok battalion, which is composed of ethnic-
Chechens loyal to Moscow, found a group of 10 rebel fighters
during a search near the mountain village of Tazen-Kale, Sulim
Yamadayev said.


"Seeing that they were surrounded, the rebel fighters opened
fire. In the shoot- out, four of them were destroyed," while the
others managed to escape, Yamadayev said.


There were no casualties in the Vostok battalion, Yamadayev
added.


Chechnya continues to be rocked by instability despite claims by
the Russian authorities to have normalised the situation after
years of separatist conflict dating back to the early 1990s.
