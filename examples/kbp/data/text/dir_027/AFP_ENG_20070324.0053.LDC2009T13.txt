The capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo was calm and
returning to normal Saturday following two days of deadly clashes
between rival political factions, the UN mission here said.


"Things were generally calm overnight, apart from some sporadic
gunfire. This morning, there was some firing for about 15 minutes
near the Kinshasa medical center," said Lieutenant-Colonel Didier
Rancher, military spokesman for the UN mission known as MONUC.


On Friday evening, MONUC said in a statement that "government
forces had restored order" while also deploring that the
situation had called for the use of force.


At least 60 people, most of them soldiers, have been killed in
Kinshasa since Thursday during clashes between government
soldiers and guards for ex-vice president and former warlord,
Jean-Pierre Bemba.


Bemba, who lost the presidential election in October to Joseph
Kabila, has refused to have his vice-presidential bodyguard
integrated into the regular army, arguing that his personal
security could not be guaranteed.


When the clashes erupted, Bemba sought refuge in the South
African embassy in Kinshasa.


Western security sources in the capital said 49 government troops
were killed in the fighting, and quoted commanders of Bemba's
bodyguard as saying their dead, wounded, missing or deserted
approached 400. Some of them have surrendered to the UN, with
their wives and children.
