UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged the newly formed
Palestinian unity government Saturday to meet the demands set by
the international community.


"We expect that the national unity government would meet the
expectations of the international community for the peace and the
security of the region," he said.


He was speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the second leg of his first tour of
the Middle East since taking office three months ago.


Western powers have given a cautious welcome to the Palestinian
unity cabinet, insisting it should renounce violence, recognise
Israel and agree to abide by past peace deals.


The government including ministers from both prime minister
Ismail Haniya's hardline Hamas movement and president Mahmud
Abbas' mainstream Fatah party was unveiled on March 15 after
months of intense haggling.


Ban is expected in Tel Aviv later Saturday for the third leg of a
tour he kicked off in Baghdad and is due to hold talks with Abbas
on Sunday.


"My itinerary schedule does not include meeting with prime
minster Haniya," Ban told reporters.


He said however he may hold talks with two leading moderates in
the new government, foreign minister Ziad Abu Amr and finance
minister Salam Fayyad.


Ban's visit to the region comes ahead of next week's Arab summit
in Riyadh and coincides with a trip by US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.
