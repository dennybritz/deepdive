Customs officials on Saturday said they had detained a Taiwanese-
flagged fishing vessel with 15 crew that was intercepted in
waters off north-east Australia.


Customs said officers boarded the long-line trawler Shuen Man on
Thursday about 260 nautical miles north of Lord Howe Island, off
the coast of Queensland state.


It said the vessel was being escorted to Brisbane, where the crew
will be handed over to immigration officials.


Customs said there were 15 men on board, nine of whom claimed to
be Indonesian, four Chinese and two Taiwanese.


Australia has stepped up efforts to intercept illegal fishing in
its northern waters in recent years.


"The swift response to the alleged incursion is clear evidence of
the agency's ability to take action anywhere around the
Australian coast," Customs acting enforcement chief Brian Hurrell
said in a statement.
