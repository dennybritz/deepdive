German cyclist David Kopp was looked to have suffered serious
injuries after a crash during the Spring classic Milan-San Remo
race here on Saturday.


Kopp, who appeared not to have lost consciousness, fell on the
descent from Capo Berta, around 40 kilometres from the finish.


Doctors placed a neck brace on him before taking him to hospital.


His compatriots and fellow Gerolsteiner team-mates Heinrich
Haussler and Fabian Wegmann also came down but were able to
rejoin the race.
