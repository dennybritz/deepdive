A Hindu judge took over as acting chief justice of Pakistan here
Saturday in the shadow of a judicial crisis that has jolted the
country's military leader Pervez Musharraf.


Rana Bhagwandas, the senior judge of the Supreme Court, along
with four other senior judges, will decide the fate of chief
justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, who was suspended and charged
with misconduct by the president on March 9.


National and regional bar associations boycotted Bhagwandas's
oath-taking ceremony held at the branch office in Karachi of the
Islamabad-based top court amid tight security.


The 64-year-old judge from Sindh province replaced justice Javed
Iqbal, who was acting chief judge for two weeks as Bhagwandas was
on leave in India.


Lawyers have held daily countrywide protests since the suspension
of Chaudhry. Eight judges and a deputy attorney general have
already resigned in protest.


Chaudhry has denied the charges, including that he unfairly
gained promotions for his son and insisted on the use of cars and
aircraft to which he was not entitled.


Bhagwandas is expected to head a reconstituted judicial council
for a further hearing in the case against Chaudhry, which is
scheduled for April 3.


In his brief comments soon after the oath-taking, Bhagwandas said
he would follow the law and the constitution.


"The Supreme Judicial Council will decide this case on merit,
according to the law and the constitution," he told reporters.


The council held two sessions last week and a scheduled third
sitting was postponed amid demonstrations by the legal community
demanding the reinstatement of Chaudhry.
