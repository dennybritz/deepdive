US-led forces raiding suspected insurgent hideouts in an upscale
area of Baghdad stumbled across 150 cases of booze stashed with
the usual accoutrements of war, the army said on Saturday.


On a third day of clearing operations in the western Sunni Arab
district of Mansur, the military said the 100 cases of Smirnoff
and 50 cases of Johnny Walker were unearthed along with three
hand grenades and several passports.


Fifty gallons (189 litres) of nitric acid were also found in
other caches of explosives, weapons and ammunition.


In the four years since the US-led invasion, Islamic
fundamentalists have waged deadly intimidation campaigns against
alcohol retailers in a country where most people are observant
Muslims who abstain from alcohol consumption.


The US military also bans alcohol consumption among its service
personnel deployed in Iraq.
