China's government has appointed Xi Jinping, party secretary of
Zhejiang province, as Shanghai's new chief, the government
announced Saturday.


Xi, 53, will take over from acting party secretary Han Zheng, who
is also the eastern city's mayor, said the brief dispatch from
the official Xinhua news agency.


Han stepped in after former Shanghai boss Chen Liangyu was fired
and arrested in September for his alleged role in city's biggest
corruption case, which involved hundreds of millions of dollars
from retirement funds.


It was not immediately clear from the Xinhua report if Han would
continue as mayor of Shanghai, China's largest city.


Xi's appointment could however signal that the central government
is ending its graft-busting investigation into the Shanghai graft
case that involved more than 20 senior officials and businessmen.


The scandal, which first emerged last July, involved the misuse
of 400 million dollars from Shanghai's pension fund that wound up
in real estate and road investment projects.


It led to Chen's ouster in the highest-level firing of a
government official in more than a decade, and exemplified the
rampant corruption among the party's rank and file that President
Hu Jintao has made a public pledge to combat.


Nine government officials and businessmen involved in the graft
scandal have been expelled from the ruling Communist Party and
are awaiting criminal charges in the case.


Xi, the son of a former top government official, Xi Zhongxun, is
regarded as pro-business, according to a Hong Kong press report.
