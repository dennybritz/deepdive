Thirteen people died and three were wounded following a head-on
collision between two commuter vans in southern Pakistan, police
said Saturday.


The accident occurred late Friday on a highway near the town of
Khairpur, 450 kilometres (280 miles) north of Karachi, town
police chief Deen Mohammad Baluch said.


The officer blamed the crash on speeding by the two drivers.


"Twelve people died on the spot while another died in the
hospital," Baluch told AFP.


Pakistan has the world's third highest death rate from road
accidents. Vehicles are often overloaded and poorly maintained
while many roads are treacherous.
