Premiership favourites Melbourne Storm overpowered the lowly
Canberra Raiders 32-16 in Australia's National Rugby League on
Saturday.


The Raiders led for 38 minutes before the Storm hit top gear to
clear away for their second win of the new season after losing to
the Brisbane Broncos in last season's grand final.


The win ensured Melbourne maintained their near decade-long
dominance against the struggling Raiders, winning 15 of the 20
matches they have played against Canberra.


Manly's Michael Monaghan filled in seamlessly for injured scrum-
half Matt Orford, creating two of the Sea Eagles' three tries in
their 19-8 win over the Wests Tigers at Leichhardt Oval.


Monaghan cleverly switched the attack to send forward Anthony
Watmough over in the sixth minute and kicked for winger Michael
Robertson to score in the final minute of the first half.


A storm lashed the ground 10 minutes before kick-off and rain
bucketed down on the players during the warm-up and for periods
during the match.


Manly coped better with the conditions, scoring three tries to
one with Jamie Lyon booting three goals from five attempts.


Monaghan kicked a drop goal in the final minute of the match.


North Queensland Cowboys scored seven tries in smashing the
Sydney Roosters 43-6 in Townsville.
