Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday dismissed US
criticism of a forthcoming referendum on constitutional changes,
ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.


"We take the path towards reform with conviction and without
looking back," Mubarak told a gathering in the southern city of
Assiut.


"I will not accept pressures or orders or conditions," he said.
"I will not be swayed into gambling with the future of this
nation and I will be relentless in defending the future of its
people."


Rice said Friday the lack of democratic change in Egypt was
"disappointing" and voiced her concern over Monday's referendum.


Egyptian opposition and human rights groups have described the
constitutional changes -- which were already approved by
parliament -- as a major setback for pluralism and basic
freedoms.
