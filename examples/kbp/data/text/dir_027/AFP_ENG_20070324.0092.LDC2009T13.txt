The Nigerian federal government is set to partially commercialise
four of its major state-owned media organisations in a bid to
make them self-sustaining financially, officials said Saturday.


The government plans to partially commercialise the News Agency
of Nigeria (NAN), the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), the
Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) and the Nigerian Film
Corporation (NFC).


After their commercialisation, the four agencies would still be
eligible for grants to finance their capital projects because of
the social services the organisations provide.


"They would be expected to generate enough revenue to cover the
operating expenditure," one of the officials, who demanded
anonymity, said.


All these media agencies, totally owned by the federal
government, depend on government financing for their operations.
