German sports car builder Porsche said Saturday it wants to take
control of the giant Volkswagen group, in which it already holds
a 27.3 percent stake.


A statement issued after a special board meeting said that
Porsche would initially raise its stake to up to 31 percent,
which under German law would oblige it to make a full takeover
bid.


Porsche, which said it will exercise an option to purchase up to
a further 3.7 percent of VW shares, had previously denied growing
rumours of a takeover move.
