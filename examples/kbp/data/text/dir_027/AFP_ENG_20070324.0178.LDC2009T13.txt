Efforts are underway to establish contacts with gunmen who
kidnapped three foreign construction workers in Nigeria's Niger
Delta, and to get the hostages freed, officials said Saturday.


The victims kidnapped in two separate incidents Friday were
Dutch, Indian and Lebanese. They were the latest in a string of
foreign workers abducted in the volatile region.


"We are making progress in establishing contacts with the
abductors of the Indian and Lebanese, knowing the whereabouts of
these hostages and eventually getting them released," a spokesman
of Delta State government, Sheddy Ozoene, told AFP.


The Indian and the Lebanese were seized from a construction site
at Agbarho in Delta State where they were working, state police
commissioner Udom Ekpoudom said.


The Dutchman was kidnapped Friday morning in Port Harcourt,
Nigeria's oil capital, in the southern Rivers State, Rivers
police commissioner Felix Ogbaudu told AFP.


Ogbaudu said the man, a security officer, "heard shooting, came
out to see what was happening and was immediately seized."


"We are making efforts to locate the Dutchman and get him freed,"
a senior Rivers State government official told AFP.
