Insurgents killed a US soldier in Baghdad as he was conducting a
foot patrol as part of the massive security operation in the
capital, the military reported on Saturday.


The soldier was killed on Friday when a roadside bomb detonated
near him in southern Baghdad, a statement said.


The latest casualty took the military's losses in Iraq since the
March 2003 invasion to 3,229, according to Pentagon.


About 90,000 US and Iraqi troops are currently deployed in
Baghdad to curb the insurgent and sectarian violence that has
left tens of thousands of Iraqis dead.
