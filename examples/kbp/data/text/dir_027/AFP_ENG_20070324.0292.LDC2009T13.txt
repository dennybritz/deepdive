Rescuers recovered the bodies late Saturday of 14 miners killed
when their coal mine flooded in central China, state media said,
as police searched for two managers who fled after the accident.


Fifty two miners were working underground when the accident
occurred late on Thursday at the Shangjiuwu coal mine in Henan
province, official Xinhua news agency said.


Rescuers were working to find another miner confirmed dead,
Xinhua said, without making clear the fate of the other 37 miners
underground at the time.


Mine managers did not immediately report Thursday's accident to
local safety authorities, instead organising their own rescue
attempts.


Residents near the mine in Ruzhou city tipped off local
government authorities Friday morning sparking an official
response, Xinhua said.


Police have since detained the mine's owner and were searching
for the two missing managers. The bank account of the privately-
owned mine has been frozen.


The cause of the flood is being investigated, Xinhua also said.


China's mines are the most dangerous in the world, with 4,746
miners dying in 2,845 accidents last year, according to official
figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.


Xinhua said the Shangjiuwu mine had been upgrading production
facilities before the accident. It had also won government
approval to raise its annual capacity from 90,000 tonnes to
150,000 tonnes.
