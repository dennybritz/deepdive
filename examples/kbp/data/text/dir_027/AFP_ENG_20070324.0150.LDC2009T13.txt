Pope Benedict XVI warned here on Saturday that Europe's revival
could be threatened if it forgets its Christian roots.


As European Union leaders met in Berlin to mark the EU's 50th
anniversary, the pope urged them not to "neglect the peoples'
identity... formed from a set of values that Christianity has
helped to forge."


He made the remarks as he received participants of a conference
organised by European bishops here to mark half a century since
the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which laid the foundation for
today's EU.
