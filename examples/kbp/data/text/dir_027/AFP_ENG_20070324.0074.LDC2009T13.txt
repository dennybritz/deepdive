Israel was awaiting the arrival on Saturday of UN chief Ban Ki-
Moon, who is making his first official Middle East visit amid a
flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at kickstaring peace efforts.


Defence Minister Amir Peretz is slated to greet Ban at Tel Aviv's
Ben Gurion airport, where the two will hold talks, Peretz's
office said.


On Sunday, Ban is due in the West Bank city of Ramallah to meet
with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. He will then head back
to Jerusalem for a meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice, who is returning to the region for the third time this
year.


On Monday, Ban will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert
before travelling on to Jordan and then Saudi Arabia


He is due to conclude his regional tour with a visit to Lebanon
for talks with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and his political
opponent Parliament speaker Nabih Berri.


In Riyadh, Ban will attend the Wednesday opening session of an
Arab League summit that will be closely watched for signs of
renewed support for a dormant five-year-old Arab initiative for
peace with Israel.
