When EU leaders dine in honour of the bloc's 50th anniversary
Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be the only woman in
the room, leaving her professor husband to lunch with the 26
wives.


"Parallel to the dinner for the leaders, Professor Sauer will
host a luncheon for their partners," government spokesman Ulrich
Wilhelm said.


Joachim Sauer, a physicist, is so reclusive that he even skipped
his wife's swearing-in as chancellor in November 2005.


But he has gradually emerged from the shadows for appearances at
Merkel's side -- most recently on a visit to Poland this month.


The only three female heads of state in Europe -- Finland's Tarja
Halonen, Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia and Ireland's Mary
McAleese -- skipped the festivities in Berlin, dispatching their
government chiefs instead.


So Professor Sauer, a quantum chemist, will squire the 26 other
spouses at a banquet of his own in Berlin's swank new Hotel de
Rome, after joining Merkel and the EU couples for a gala concert
at the Philharmonic late Saturday.
