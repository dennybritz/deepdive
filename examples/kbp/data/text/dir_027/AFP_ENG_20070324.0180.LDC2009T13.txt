Celtic midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura had a hand in both goals as
Japan beat Peru 2-0 on Saturday in an international friendly in
their run-up to the defence of their Asian Cup title later this
year.


Nakamura, called up for the national team for the first time
since Japan coach Ivica Osim was appointed, crossed for Seiichiro
Maki to score in the 19th minute.


Nakamura struck a free kick from the left in the 54th minute and
striker Naohiro Takahara fired home.


It was Japan's first win against Peru in four games. They had
previously lost twice and drawn once.
