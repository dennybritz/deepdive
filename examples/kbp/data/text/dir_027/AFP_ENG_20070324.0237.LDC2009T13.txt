Latin American multiple Grammy award singer Shakira arrived in
Mumbai Saturday for her first hip-shaking Indian performance.


Shakira, who is on a world tour for her "Oral Fixation Vol. 2"
album, will be performing some of her biggest hits including
"Hips don't lie", "Don't bother" and "Illegal" at the concert
Sunday night in India's entertainment and financial capital.


"I love India and its people. I have a lot of fans in India and
love the culture and food," Shakira told reporters adding she was
looking forward to her concert.


Best known for sensual belly dancing and her powerful voice,
Shakira will stay in the presidential suite at a five-star hotel
in Mumbai, media reports said.


The pop star will be pampered with her favourite exotic fruits --
papayas from Hawaii, peaches and prunes from Dubai and Australian
berries, Mumbai's Mirror newspaper reported.


In the run-up to Shakira's arrival, local newspapers have carried
articles detailing how to learn the singer's dance moves.


Shakira, who won Grammy awards in 2001 and 2003, dominated the
Latin Grammy awards last year, winning four trophies, including
album of the year for "Fijacion Oral Vol. 1".
