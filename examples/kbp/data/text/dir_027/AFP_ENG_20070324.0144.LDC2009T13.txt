Insurgents have killed two US soldiers in separate attacks on
military patrols in Baghdad and the flashpoint Al-Anbar province
in the west, the military reported on Saturday.


One soldier was killed on Friday when a roadside bomb detonated
near him in south Baghdad, a statement said.


A second soldier died while conducting combat operations in Al-
Anbar.


The latest casualties took to 3,229 the military's losses in Iraq
since the March 2003 invasion, according to an AFP count based on
Pentagon figures.


About 90,000 US and Iraqi troops are deployed in Baghdad to curb
insurgent and sectarian violence that has left tens of thousands
of Iraqis dead in the four years since the overthrow of president
Saddam Hussein.
