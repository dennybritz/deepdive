Stakes in two banks owned by bankrupt Russian oil giant Yukos are
to be auctioned off next month, the Interfax news agency reported
on Saturday, citing the federal property fund.


A 7.69-percent stake in VTB Bank Deutschland is to be sold with a
starting price of 8.9 million dollars (6.7 million euros) on
April 25, the fund said in an announcement in the official
Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily.


On April 26, a 1.998-percent stake in Khanty-Mansiisk Bank will
also be sold starting at 6.3 million dollars, the announcement
said.


Auctions start on Tuesday for prize assets from Yukos, the energy
empire that was built up by jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky
and was dismembered in a series of inquiries seen by critics as
politically motivated.


The court-appointed official overseeing the liquidation, Eduard
Rebgun, said earlier this month that the assets will be sold off
by August.
