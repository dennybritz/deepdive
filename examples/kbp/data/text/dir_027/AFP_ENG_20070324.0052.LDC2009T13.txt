China's government has appointed Xi Jinping, party secretary of
Zhejiang province, as Shanghai's new chief, the government
announced Saturday.


Xi, 53, will take over from acting party secretary Han Zheng, who
is also the eastern city's mayor, said the brief dispatch from
the official Xinhua news agency.


Former Shanghai boss Chen Liangyu was fired and arrested in
September for his alleged role in China's biggest corruption case
in a decade.
