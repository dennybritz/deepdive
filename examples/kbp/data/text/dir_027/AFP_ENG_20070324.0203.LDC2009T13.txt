England recalled Andrew Flintoff for their key World Cup clash
against Kenya at the Beausejour Cricket Ground here Saturday.


The star all-rounder had been stripped of the vice-captaincy and
dropped from the side's 51-run victory against Canada on Sunday
as a disciplinary measure after being one of six players fined
for late night driking following the six- wicket defeat against
New Zealand.


Flintoff effectively took the place of dropped off-spinner Jamie
Dalrymple.


Meanwhile, in a change an England spokesman said was purely a
matter of selection, fast bowler Sajid Mahmood, making his World
Cup debut, replaced fellow quick Liam Plunkett


Medium-pace bowling all-rounder Ravi Bopara, who made his World
Cup debut against Canada as Flintoff's replacement, was retained.


The winners of this match will qualify for the second phase,
Super Eight stage alongside Group C table-toppers New Zealand.


Rain delayed the scheduled start 9.30am local time (1330GMT)
start with the match now no longer a 50 overs per side contest.
