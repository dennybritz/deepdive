A massive truck bombing killed 20 Iraqis at a police station in
Bagdad on Saturday after a suicide bomber drove a lorry packed
with bricks into the heavily guarded compound, a security
official said.


Sixteen policemen, two detainees being held at the police station
and two civilians were among the dead, the source told AFP on
condition of anonymity.
