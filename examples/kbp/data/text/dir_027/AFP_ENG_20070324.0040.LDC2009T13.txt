Shanghai will host the 2011 World Swimming Championships after
fending off a bid from the Qatari capital Doha, world swimming's
governing body FINA announced here on Saturday.


FINA's selection came with the 12th edition of the championships
underway in Melbourne. The 2009 championships are in Rome.


Only two cities were in the race for the 2011 event, which will
be held in July.


"We had two bids and we have listened to both of their
presentations," said FINA president Mustapha Larfaoui.


"I'd like to thank both bidders who each had a very, very good
presentation. The winner of the bid to host the 2011 world
championships is Shanghai."


Chinese delegates cheered and hugged each other after the result
was announced.


Shanghai had a dry run by holding the world short course
championships in April last year, but it has never played host to
the long course version.


The only other time the event was in Asia was 2001 when they were
held in Fukuoka, Japan.


China, though, is increasingly seen as a destination for top
sports events with an economy racing along and the eyes of the
world turning to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.


Along with the swimming championships, China has Formula One and
MotoGP committed to seven-year stints while top golf events are
multiplying by the year.


As well as the Olympics, the country will play host to the 2010
Asian Games in the southern city of Guangzhou.


Gas-rich Doha is positioning itself as a sports hub of the Far
East and last year successfully hosted the Asian Games.


The World Swimming Championships were first held in Belgrade in
1973.
