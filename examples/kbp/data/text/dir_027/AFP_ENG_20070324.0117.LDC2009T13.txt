Ukrainian police have arrested a man suspected of forcing more
than 200 women to work as prostitutes in the Czech Republic, the
interior ministry said on Saturday.


The 46-year-old Kiev resident is accused of organising a network
across Ukraine over the past two years to recruit young women
looking to work abroad and force them into prostitution, the
interior ministry said in a statement.


Human trafficking is punishable by up to eight years in prison in
Ukraine.


The interior ministry said that 160 of the women sold off as sex
slaves by the trafficking gang headed up by the man have already
been freed and returned to Ukraine.


Traffickers in former Soviet republics often lure young women
with the promise of lucrative jobs abroad, then take away their
passports and force them into prostitution.
