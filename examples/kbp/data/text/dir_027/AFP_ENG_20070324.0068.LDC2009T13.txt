UN chief Ban Ki-moon said on Saturday that an expansion of the
world body's presence in Iraq was still on the cards, two days
after a blast rattled his news conference in Baghdad and made him
flinch.


"We are now considering ... what the UN can do, including the
increase of presence of the UN in Iraq and also further assisting
the political, economic and social reconstruction," he said.


The UN secretary general was speaking to reporters after a
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo, on the
second leg of his first Middle East tour since taking office
three months ago.


On Thursday, a mortar shell struck in Baghdad's fortified Green
Zone area, a few yards (metres) away from the hall where Ban and
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki were giving a press
conference.


The explosion, which an Iraqi official said was caused by a
mortar shell, caused no injuries but sent a shock wave through
the room and caused Ban to flinch.


A bomb at the UN headquarters in Baghdad on August 19, 2003
killed 22 people, including top UN envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.
The world body's presence in war- torn Iraq has been minimal ever
since.
