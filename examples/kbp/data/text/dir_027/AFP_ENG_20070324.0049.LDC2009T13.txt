A man in eastern China hacked two government officials to death
and injured one after being compensated less for his house than
his neighbours, state press reported Saturday.


Ma Xueming butchered a man and a woman from Suzhou city's housing
relocation department in China's Jiangsu province after walking
into their office and blinding them with lime powder, the Beijing
News reported.


A third woman was able to escape, the newspaper said.


Ma was apparently angry about receiving only 400,000 yuan (51,600
US dollars) in compensation for his home when most residents had
received one million.


The case was still being investigated, the newspaper said.


The report did not say if Ma had been caught by police.
