Swedish truck maker Volvo has successfully acquired Japan's
Nissan Diesel, the companies said Saturday, the latest merger in
the industry as companies prepare for more stringent emissions
rules.


In a friendly takeover bid Volvo received roughly 96 percent of
the shares outstanding in truck maker Nissan Diesel Motor Co.
Ltd.


Nissan Diesel controls nearly a quarter of the Japanese truck
market.


"It is pleasing that we received such a level of acceptance,"
Volvo's chief executive Leif Johansson said in a statement. "We
foresee major mutual benefits for the Volvo Group and Nissan
Diesel with this transaction and it is highly satisfying that
owners in Nissan Diesel share this view."


Nissan Diesel has said the deal would allow greater investment in
research and development to meet global regulations on vehicle
emissions, which are expected to become more costly in the United
States, Japan and Europe by 2010.


Volvo, which previously owned a 19 percent stake in Nissan
Diesel, had proposed 540 yen per share for the remainder of the
company, valuing the Japanese group at 135 billion yen (812
million euros, 1.01 billion dollars).


Volvo has concentrated on trucks after selling its Volvo Cars
division to US group Ford in the late 1990s.


In 2001, the Swedish truck maker took over Renault Trucks, the
heavy division of French group Renault.
