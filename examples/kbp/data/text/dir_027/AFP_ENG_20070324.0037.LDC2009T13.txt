Shanghai will host the 2011 World Swimming Championships after
fending off a bid from the Qatari capital Doha, world swimming's
governing body FINA announced here on Saturday.


FINA's selection came on the eve of the 12th edition of the
championships, which were to start in Melbourne on Sunday. The
2009 championships are in Rome.


Only two cities were in the race for the 2011 event, which will
be held in July.


"We had two bids and we have listened to both of their
presentations," said FINA president Mustapha Larfaoui.


"I'd like to thank both bidders who each had a very, very good
presentation. The winner of the bid to host the 2011 world
championships is Shanghai."


China has never played host to the championships before with its
only other time in Asia being in 2001 when they were held in
Fukuoka, Japan.
