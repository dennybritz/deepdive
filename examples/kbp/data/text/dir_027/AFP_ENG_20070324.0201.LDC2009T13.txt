Naples is considering calling a state of emergency and deploying
the army to combat rising violence, much of it linked to Mafia
activity, a news agency report said Saturday quoting the city's
mayor.


The report came a day after another murder occurred in the
southern Italian city, ANSA news agency said.


"I never believed in the presence of soldiers who have no link
with the area, but in an emergency situation such as ours, we
cannot exclude anything," said Mayor Rosa Russo Iervolino.


Vincenzo Cerbone, 27 and known as a local criminal, was killed
amid a crowd in the center of the city by unknown assailants
Friday afternoon, while his wife was injured.


On Tuesday the body of a Nigerian known to Italian police as
being involved in drug activity was found in an area just south
of Naples. More than a week ago, three men were shot down within
several hours.


In November, 12 people were killed over the course of about 10
days, causing the Italian government to send police
reinforcements.


Interior Minister Giuliano Amato was scheduled to visit Naples
next week to check up on an anti-crime plan launched in November
targeting the Camorra mafia.
