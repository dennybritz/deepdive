Carlos Bueno scored two goals to give Uruguay a 2-0 victory over
South Korea in a friendly match here on Saturday.


Uruguay stretched their winning streak to four over South Korea,
who have never won a match against any Latin Americans since
2001.


Saturday's loss gave South Korea a record of four draws and six
losses since 2001 against South American teams.


The Koreans seemed in control at the start of the match, with a
shot from Lee Chun-Soo in the 15th minute barely saved by the
Uruguay 'keeper.


But Bueno took a long cross from Alvaro Recoba of Inter Milan and
converted the only chance Uruguay had got until then into a goal
in the 20th minute.


He made it two in the 38th minute.


The South Americans shut up shop in the second half and almost
paid for that as South Korea substitute Kim Do-Heon went close in
the 50th minute.


And Seol Ki-Hyeon's shot near the penalty area in the dying
minute hit the goal post.


Three South Koreans playing in England's Premier League - Park
Ji-Sung of Manchester United, who scored two goals last Saturday
against Bolton, Lee Young- Pyo of Tottenham and Seol Ki-Hyeon of
Reading - returned home on Wednesday.


But their lack of coordination stemming from the shortage of time
to prepare for the match was evident.


South Korea, currently 48th in FIFA's world rankings, are now in
a team-building phase for the Asian Cup in July. The South
Koreans had some confidence going in following a 1-0 victory over
European champions Greece in London last month.
