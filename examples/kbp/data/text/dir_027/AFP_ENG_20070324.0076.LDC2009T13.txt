The Constitutional Court of Benin has decided to delay
legislative elections set for Sunday until the end of the month
due to difficulties in organising the poll, a court member told
AFP Saturday.


"Following a request from the independent national electoral
commission (CENA) to the court yesterday (Friday), we have
decided that it is acceptable to carry forward (the election)
from Sunday to next Saturday, March 31," said a judge on the
court, who requested anonymity.


"The ballots are not ready, the equipment has not been
transported and the poll workers have still not been trained,"
the judge added.


Some four million people are eligible to vote in the elections
that will choose 83 members of the legislature from among 2,158
candidates from 26 political parties and groups.


The legislative polls are a crucial test for Benin's President
Yayi Boni, a virtual political unknown who was the surprise
winner of the presidential poll in March last year.


Elected with 74 percent of the vote, the former banker made
economic growth and the fight against corruption a major plank of
his campaign.
