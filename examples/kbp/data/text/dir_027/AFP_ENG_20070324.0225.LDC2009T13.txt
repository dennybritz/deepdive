Spaniard Oscar Freire of the Rabobank team won the centenary
Milan-San Remo, the opening one-day classic of the season, for
the second time here on Saturday.


The 31-year-old reclaimed the title he last won in 2004 ahead of
Australian Allan Davis, who was followed by Belgian Tom Boonen
and Australian Robbie McEwen.


Freire, world champion in 1999, 2001, 2004, had been just behind
Alessandro Petacchi but claimed the title after a sprint finish
as his Italian rival dropped to eighth following the 294km race.
