South African captain Graeme Smith won the toss and elected to
bowl first against Australia in the World Cup Group A match at
Warner Park here on Saturday.


South Africa kept the same side which beat Scotland in their last
match on Tuesday, while Australia brought back all-rounder Andrew
Symonds in place of Brad Hodge from their line-up which beat the
Netherlands.


Symonds was cleared to play after last month's arm surgery kept
him out of the game for nearly one month. He was playing his
first match in the World Cup.
