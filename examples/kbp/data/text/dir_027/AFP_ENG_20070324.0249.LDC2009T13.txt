Mexico's Lorena Ochoa completed a bogey-free eight-under par 64
here Saturday to grab a three-stroke lead after the darkness-
halted second round of the LPGA Safeway International.


Ochoa, last year's LPGA Player of the Year, stood on 11-under par
133 after 36 holes at the 1.5 million-dollars event with
Scotland's Catriona Matthew second on 136 and Norway's Suzann
Pettersen another stroke off the pace.


Players began late Friday after a storm delay interrupted
Thursday's first round, pushing back the finish of round two as
well. In all, 74 players made the cut on three-over 147 into the
afternoon's third round start.


Ochoa birdied the 16th and par-5 18th for the second round in a
row while Matthew parred the 18th to conclude her round.
Pettersen had been the clubhouse leader.


Ochoa's most dazzling shots came late Friday when she eagled the
par-4 sixth and par-5 13th.


South Koreans Jeong Jang and Gloria Park shared fourth on 138
while two more Koreans, Hee-Won Han and Shi Hyun Ahn, shared
sixth on 140.


Swedish star Annika Sorenstam was on 141 along with compatriot
Sophie Gustafson, Korean Ki Hyun Kim and American Laura Diaz.
