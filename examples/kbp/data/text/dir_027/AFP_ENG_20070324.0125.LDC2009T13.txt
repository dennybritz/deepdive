Fifteen British sailors and marines detained off Iraq by the
Iranian navy have admitted illegally entering Iranian waters,
senior Iranian commander General Alireza Afshar said on Saturday.


"They are currently being questioned and have admitted to
violating the territorial waters of the Islamic repubic," Afshar,
the official spokesman of the army chief of staff, told the semi-
official Fars news agency.


He told the Arabic language service of state television: "We have
solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters.
They themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake."
