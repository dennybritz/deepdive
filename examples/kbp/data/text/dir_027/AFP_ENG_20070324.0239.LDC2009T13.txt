UN emergency relief coordinator John Holmes was blocked Saturday
by the Sudanese army from visiting a camp for the displaced in
war-torn Darfur during his first visit to the country, a UN
spokeswoman said.


After meeting with non governmental organizations in the northern
Darfur town of Kutum, Holmes' convoy was stopped by a military
checkpoint from reaching Kassab refugee camp, said Dawn Blalock
of the UN's Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.


"Mr Holmes said he was very frustrated and quite annoyed and he
can understand now what the NGOs are experiencing," she said,
adding that he had had all the necessary permits and security
clearances.


She said that Holmes will bring the matter up before high-ranking
Sudanese officials.
