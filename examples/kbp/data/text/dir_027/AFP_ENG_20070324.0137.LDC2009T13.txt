US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived in Egypt Saturday
on the first leg of a regional tour aimed at reviving Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks.


Rice is scheduled to hold talks in the southern Egyptian city of
Aswan with officials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the
United Arab Emirates.


Washington has been trying to enlist the help of the so-called
"Arab quartet" to breathe new life into a long-dormant Saudi
peace initiative launched at a 2002 Arab summit in Beirut.


Rice's visit comes less than two weeks after the Palestinians
unveiled a national unity government including members of both
prime minister Ismail Haniya's Islamist Hamas and president
Mahmud Abbas's secular Fatah.


The top US diplomat's consultations are part of a flurry of
regional diplomatic activity ahead of next week's Arab summit in
Riyadh.


She is expected to hold talks on Sunday with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, who already met UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon,
also on a regional tour.
