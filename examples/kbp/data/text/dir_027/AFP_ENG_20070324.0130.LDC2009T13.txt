The German presidency of the European Union on Saturday urged the
immediate release of 15 British naval personnel seized by Iranian
forces in the Gulf.


"We demand the immediate release of the British soldiers," German
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters ahead of
a meeting of European socialists.


Steinmeier said the 27 leaders of the EU, who have gathered in
Berlin to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloc, would issue
a joint statement later demanding the freedom of the sailors and
marines.


He added he was "confident" that the United Nations Security
Council would pass a resolution introducing harsher sanctions
against Tehran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment.


The 15 British personnel were seized in the Shatt al-Arab
waterway between Iran and Iraq Friday as they conducted "routine"
anti-smuggling operations.


The semi-official Fars news agency in Iran said the 15 had been
taken to Tehran for questioning for "failing to respect
international frontiers and for illegally entering Iranian
territorial waters."


The 15 UN Security Council members reached broad agreement late
Friday ahead of a vote Saturday on an amended draft resolution
that expanded UN sanctions imposed on Iran in December for
spurning repeated demands to freeze its sensitive nuclear fuel
work.
