Norway's Marit Bjoergen won the nordic ski World Cup pursuit race
here on Saturday ahead of Katerina Neumonnova of the Czech
Republic and her compatriot Therese Hohaug.


Finland's Virpi Kuitunen, who was already assured of winning the
overall World Cup, eased off the pedal and finished in a lowly
28th place.
