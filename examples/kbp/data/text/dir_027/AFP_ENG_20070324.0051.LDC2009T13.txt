Insurgents killed eight people and wounded more than a dozen in
attacks in Baghdad on Saturday, including a suicide truck bombing
against a police station, security officials said.


Five people were killed and 10 wounded, mostly policemen, when
the bomber blew up his truck near a police station in the restive
south Baghdad Sunni district of Dura.


Four policemen were among the dead and eight among the wounded, a
defence ministry official said.


In south Baghdad's Abu Chir district, mortar fire killed three
people and wounded seven more, including two women and a child,
the official said.


Insurgents have continued to carry out attacks in Baghdad despite
the launch of a massive security operation last month to curb the
insurgent and sectarian bloodshed.


On Friday, deputy prime minister Salam al-Zubayi was wounded when
a suicide bomber blew himself up in the residential compound of
the senior Sunni Arab in the Shiite-led government.


Zubayi is undergoing treatment at a US military hospital in
Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone.
