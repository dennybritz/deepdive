Mao Anqing, believed to be the last known son of the founder of
communist China, Mao Zedong, has died at 84, state media reported
Saturday.


A funeral service was held after Mao Anqing died Friday, the
China News Service reported, without giving the cause of death.


Mao Anqing was born in the central province of Hunan, the second
child of Mao and his first wife Yang Kaihui, who was arrested in
the provincial capital of Changsha and executed in 1930 by a
warlord, according to the dispatch.


Some historical accounts say she was killed by the then ruling
Nationalists.


In 1933, Mao Anqing was beaten by police in Shanghai, prompting
life-long mental illness, the report said.


Mao Anqing and his elder brother Mao Anying were sent to Paris
and Moscow to escape the growing war with Japan and the civil war
between the communists and nationalists.


They returned to China in 1947.


Mao Anqing was then given a titular post in a military research
institute. He was never involved in politics and lived in Dalian
in China's northeast for many years, marrying Shao Hua, who bore
him a son, Mao Xinyu, in 1970.


His brother was killed in the 1950-1953 Korean War.


Mao Zedong, who died in 1976, also had two daughters, Li Na and
Li Min, by two other wives.


Well known for his promiscuity, it has long been thought that Mao
Zedong had more children, but none has ever been identified.
