Italy's Gianpaolo Pazzini made his mark on the football history
books here on Saturday as he scored the first goal at the
revamped Wembley Stadium in the England Under-21 v Italy Under-21
international.


Pazzini took just 25 seconds to score with a rasping long range
effort that took a slight deflection off Anton Ferdinand and flew
past goalkeeper Lee Camp.


Tickets for the first football match to be played at the rebuilt
stadium sold out within hours of their having gone on sale.


Though only about two-thirds of the seats at the 90,000-capacity
national ground were filled - Wembley is being tested to get its
safety certificate - the FA said it was still the "largest ever
under-21s crowd in world football history."


The FA were given the keys to Wembley earlier this month after
work on it was finally completed, years behind schedule and at a
final cost of 800 million pounds.


The March 24 match is the second of two "ramp-up" events to
ensure the stadium is in working order, the first being a March
17 community day.
