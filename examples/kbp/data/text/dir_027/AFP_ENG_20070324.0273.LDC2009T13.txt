A right hamstring injury suffered during exercises here on Friday
will keep Taiwan pitcher Chien-Ming Wang out of the New York
Yankees lineup for up to a month, officials said Saturday.


A report on the Major League Baseball club's official website
said the Asian right-hander, who turns 27 next Saturday, is
expected to miss at least the first three weeks of the Major
League Baseball season that opens April 1.


"I don't look for him to touch our major league roster until
sometime in late April," Yankees general manager Brian Cashman
said.


Wang was sprinting after fielding practice here at the Yankees'
spring training complex when he said he felt a pain in the
hamstring. Exams on Friday night confirmed the injury.


"I want to come back 100 percent," Wang said. "I hope it gets
better."


Wang, runner-up in last year's American League voting for the Cy
Young Award as best pitcher, was among those being considered as
the Yankees' pitcher in their opener at home on April 2.


Last season, Wang went 19-6 with a 3.63 earned-run average in 34
games and in pre-season outings this month he was 1-1 with a 2.57
earned-run average.


In his 2005 US debut season, Wang was sidelined with shoulder
swelling from July 13 to September 6.
