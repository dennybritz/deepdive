Eric Medlen, a 33-year-old US racer in the National Hot Rod
Association (NHRA) series, died here Friday from severe head
injuries suffered in a crash.


Three days after brain surgery, Medlen was taken off artificial
life support systems by his family, according to physician Joseph
Layon, chief of critical care medicine at the University of
Florida.


Medlen, a Funny Car racer who won six times on the NHRA tour, was
injured when his hybrid car crashed into the right-side guardwall
on the drag strip at Gainesville Raceway.


Medlen finished fourth in the NHRA Funny Car standings each of
the past two years. He was a crew member for John Force Racing
before becoming a driver for the team owned by the famed former
racer.


NHRA president Tom Compton called Medlen one of the brightest
stars in the series.


"Words cannot describe how everyone at NHRA is feeling," Compton
said. "He earned his way to the top through hard work and
perseverance and, in doing so, gained the respect of his fellow
competitors."
