A double from Barcelona star Ronaldinho inspired Brazil to a 4-0
rout over Chile in a football friendly here on Saturday being
used as a warm-up for this summer's Copa America.


Brazil coach Carlos Dunga was able to try out for the first time
the strike force trio of Kaka, Ronaldinho and Robinho whom he is
planning to use during their Copa America defence in Venezuela in
June.


And the experiment proved positive as Ronaldinho opened when he
converted a controversial penalty awarded after 16th minutes for
a foul by Alex von Schwedler on Gilberto Silva.


Brazil added their second afer 31 minutes when Daniel Alves
escaped down the right and passed to AC Milan's Kaka, who
finished off.


Ronaldinho - who it has been suggested is trying to get out of
playing in the Copa because he is exhausted after almost two
years of incessant football - doubled his account after 50
minutes with Bayer Leverkusen's Juan adding a fourth after 59
minutes.


The result was a blow for Chile coach Nelson Acosta's whose side
had surprised the five-time world champions by dominating the
first ten minutes.


But after scoring Brazil soon got into their stride.


Chile had their best chance after 38 minutes when a Luis Figueroa
cross from the right found Gonzalez, only for his header to be
diverted out.


Second half substitute Valdivia lifted the Chileans but they
could not find a way past the Brazilians.
