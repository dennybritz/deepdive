South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun, beginning a regional tour
aimed at boosting economic ties, arrived in the Saudi capital
Riyadh on Saturday, the official Saudi Press Agency said.


He will spend two days in Saudi Arabia before heading to Kuwait
and then Qatar, his presidential office said earlier on Saturday.


"The visit will provide an opportunity to expand our partnership
and cooperation with the countries in energy resources,
infrastructure construction, defence industry and information
technology," it said.


Some 200 South Korean business leaders are accompanying the
president.
