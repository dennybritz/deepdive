Estonia's national election commission on Saturday declared the
official results of the parliamentary election held on March 4
after all complaints filed after the vote were thrown out by the
courts.


The right-of-centre Reform Party did best in the election,
winning 27.8 percent of the vote, or 31 seats in the 101-member
single-chamber legislature, the final results showed.


Reform narrowly beat its main coalition partner in the outgoing
government, the Centre Party, which garnered 26.1 percent of the
vote, or 29 seats.


The right-of-centre Pro Patria-Res Publica Union won 17.9 percent
or 19 seats, the Social-Democratic Party 10.6 percent for 10
seats and the 7.1  percent of votes won by political newcomer the
Green Party gave it six seats.


The sixth party to get into parliament was the People's Union,
which scored exactly the same result as the Green Party.


Outgoing Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, who is head of the Reform
Party, is tipped to be officially nominated for prime minister
next week by President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, and the new
parliament is expected to hold its first session within 10 days.


Ansip has been holding talks with several parties to set up a
broad-based coalition government able to serve a full four-year
term -- something no government in Estonia has done since the
Baltic state regained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
