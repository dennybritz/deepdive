Simon Dyson was the first round pacesetter at the Portugal Open
here on Thursday, the Briton posting a four-under 67.


Dyson, turning up at the Oitavos course on the Atlantic coast
after two strong third place finishes in Asia, made the most of
benign conditions to lead the chasing pack by one stroke.


South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen, Scotland's Stephen Gallacher and
fellow Briton Ross McGowan were tied for second with defending
champion Paul Broadhurst one of a group of three a further shot
adrift.


The highlight of 29-year-old Dyson's day was a five-iron he hit
to within 20 feet for an eagle at the long 16th, his ninth, and
three birdies.


"It was just solid striking," he said.


"I only hit one bad shot and it's just about keeping your head -
it can make you look stupid at times.


"I had one shot of 100 yards and hit an eight-iron that came up
20 yards short. It was nice to start off in calmer conditions."


Paul McGinley, part of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team who has
failed to qualify for next week's US Masters, trailed in with a
five over 76.


Broadhurst, whose round was hampered when the wind began to play
its part at the exposed venue, is going for a hat-trick having
won at this course two years ago and last year at Penina.


He said: "It's just a matter of surviving. Putting is as hard as
anything and, if you back off a shot, you can end up in a
different county - you have to commit 110 percent to every shot."
