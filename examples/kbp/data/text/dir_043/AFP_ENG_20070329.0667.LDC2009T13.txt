Brazilian playmaker Fred, who led the Melbourne Victory to the
Australian club championship last month, has signed with DC
United, the Major League Soccer club announced here Thursday.


Helbert Frederico Carreiro da Silva, a 27-year-old midfielder, is
training with United in Mexico for Tuesday's North American
Champions Cup second-leg match at Chivas of Guadalajara. The
first match on March 15 was a 1-1 draw.


"Fred has terrific athletic and technical qualities and has
proven to be a dynamic attacking player. He will be an excellent
fit with our style of play," said United technical director Dave
Kasper.


Fred, no relation to the Brazilian midfielder of the same
nickname who plays for France's Lyon, shared the Most Valuable
Player award in the Aussie league.
