Britain's three-man sprint team dominated qualifying to book a
place in the final against defending champions France here at the
world track cycling championships on Thursday.


Scottish trio Craig MacLean, Ross Edgar and Chris Hoy - the
reigning Commonwealth champions - clocked the best time of
qualifying in their heat against the Netherlands.


The Dutch will now face off against Germany for the bronze medal.


Australia missed out on the medals after being dominated in their
qualifier against France.


At the 2006 world championships in Bordeaux the same French trio
of Gregory Bauge, Mickael Bourgoin and Arnaud Tournant beat
British trio MacLean, Jamie Staff and Hoy for the title.
