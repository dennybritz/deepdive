A presidential candidate in next month's election in Nigeria,
Adebayo Adefarati, has died, President Olusegun Obasanjo said on
Thursday.


The septuagenarian Adefarati was governor of Ondo State between
1999-2003. The news of Adefarati's undisclosed ailment have been
in the local media in the past couple of days. He reportedly
suffered from diabetics.


His political party, AD, was one of the two leading opposition
parties in the 2003 presidential poll, but weakened as a result
of splits within the party and the defection of notable members
such as Lagos Governor Bola Tinubu.


Although Obasanjo Thursday here publicly referred to Adefarati as
a man "who could have been to us a worthy opponent" in the April
21 presidential poll, he was widely seen as having little or no
chance of winning.


Obasanjo, while addressing the finale of his ruling party's
presidential campaign, told party members to observe a minute's
silence in honour of Adefarati.


Adefarati's spokesman Bankole Falade also confirmed the
politician's death, saying he died on Thursday afternoon.
