New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram believes his team has bowling
riches in depth to trouble all teams left in the World Cup.


Oram took 3-23 on Thursday as the Black Caps bowled out West
Indies for just 177 in 44.4 overs to put his side on course for a
Super Eights win and a fourth in four matches in the tournament.


Speedster Shane Bond and off-spinner Daniel Vettori also claimed
three wickets each as the home side looked as if they were to
suffer a second successive defeat having lost by 103 runs to
Australia on Wednesday.


"We bowled really well, we always try to bowl well as a unit,"
said Oram.


"Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori are our marquee bowlers but the
rest of us know what our jobs are and we are capable of knocking
over sides like West Indies for 177."


Oram, who came into the World Cup with a serious finger injury,
says he is fit enough to last one-day matches.


"I feel like I can get through 10 overs and that's crucial. If it
was a Test match, it would be different," said Oram.


"It's important that when you are my size you look after your
body."
