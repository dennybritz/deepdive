Greek police said they arrested seven suspected people smugglers
on Thursday for holding hostage 60 mostly Somali immigrants in
two flats in Athens.


The suspects, whose nationalities were not revealed, had locked
up 32 immigrants in a flat in the suburb of Nikea and 28 others
in a basement in the central neighbourhood of Exarchia, a police
statement said.


They were trying to get the captives to pay about 1,800 euros
(2,400 dollars) each for their passage into Greece.


The immigrants had arrived on the island of Evia near Athens by
boat after stopping over in Turkey, police said.


Greece is a main transit point for immigrants heading to Europe.
