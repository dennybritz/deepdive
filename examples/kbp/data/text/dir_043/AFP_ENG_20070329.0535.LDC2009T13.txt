The European Space Agency (ESA) signed an agreement on Thursday
with New Zealand for installing a tracking station to monitor the
maiden flight this year of an ESA supply ship for the
International Space Station (ISS).


The telemetry station, costing 200,000 euros (260,000 dollars),
will be set up at Invercargill, on the southern tip of New
Zealand's South Island, ESA said in a press release.


The automated ESA supply ship, baptised Jules Verne, will deliver
equipment, food, air and water to the ISS.


Invercargill's Awarua area was chosen as it has "excellent
visibility" of the launch trajectory, ESA said. The launch,
aboard a modified version of ESA's Ariane 5 rocket, is scheduled
to take place later this year, probably in the last quarter.
