Oscar-nominated actor Mark Wahlberg is set to star in director M.
Night Shyamalan's upcoming thriller "The Happening", Variety
reported Thursday.


The "Sixth Sense" director will begin filming in August in
Philadelphia.


Wahlberg signed to play a man who takes his family on the run as
a cataclysmic natural crisis threatens to end the world.


"Mark has a unique blend of charisma, humanity, authenticity and
skillfulness as an actor," Shyamalan said. "All of which
coalesced at this moment in his career, making him the perfect
person to take on the role of Eliot Moore, the science teacher at
the center of this event."


Shyamalan rocked Hollywood in 1999 with "Sixth Sense" which raked
in 600 million dollars worldwide, 11 times what it cost to make
the movie.
