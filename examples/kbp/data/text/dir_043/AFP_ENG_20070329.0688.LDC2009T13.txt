A French court jailed Thursday two young men for four months for
their part in a riot at a main subway station that ballooned into
a major issue for France's presidential candidates.


Prosecutors had called for six month sentences for the pair for
throwing projectiles at police on Tuesday evening at the Gare du
Nord during a riot sparked by the arrest of a fare-dodger.


The court delayed proceedings against a third youth accused of
having hidden a pair of shoes in a vandalised shop until April 25
following a demand from his lawyer.


The 18-year-old will be detained until the hearing when video
surveillance footage from the night of the riot should be
available.


About 100 youths rioted on Tuesday at the Gare du Nord, where the
mainline Eurostar terminal is a major gateway from Paris to the
rest of Europe.


Dozens of rioters attacked windows, vending machines and shops in
the main hall of the subway station for several hours before
police dispersed the crowd using tear-gas.


Eight railway officials and one police officer were lightly hurt.


The violence raised the spectre of the three weeks of riots in
autumn 2005, when clashes between police and youths on the
outskirts of Paris left hundreds of people injured.


Coming just weeks before France's presidential elections,
Tuesday's riot quickly became a political issue.


Socialist challenger Segolene Royal and centrist Francois Bayrou
have accused the ruling centre-right -- and its presidential
candidate Nicolas Sarkozy -- of creating a climate of hostility
between police and youths.
