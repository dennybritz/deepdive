Southern African leaders called for the lifting of all sanctions
against Zimbabwe at the end of an emergency meeting Thursday on
the country's political and economic crisis.


"The extraordinary summit appeals for the lifting of all forms of
sanctions against Zimbabwe," they said in a statement released in
Tanzania.


The statement defied Western and African calls to take a firmer,
not more lenient, stance on President Robert Mugabe's regime
after its recent violent crackdown on the main opposition
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).


"The extraordinary summit reaffirms its solidarity with the
government and the people of Zimbabwe," the statement said.


The host of the 14-member Southern African Development Community
(SADC) summit, Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, told a press
conference that the African leaders had called on the South
African president to head efforts to promote dialogue between
rival political parties in Zimbabwe.


"The decision has to be to entrust President (Thabo) Mbeki to
lead the process of dialogue in Zimbabwe," Jakaya Kikwete said at
the end of the two-day meeting.


"We should encourage the government, encourage the MDC, on
dialogue. If this happens, we will see a different situation in
the next elections" in 2008, Kikwete said.
