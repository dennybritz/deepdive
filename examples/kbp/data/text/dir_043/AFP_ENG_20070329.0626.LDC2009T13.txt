France successfully defended their men's team sprint crown at the
world track cycling championships here on Thursday after pipping
Great Britain to the gold in the final.


The French trio of Gregory Bauge, Mickael Bourgoin and Arnaud
Tournant had a blistering start to the three-lap event, leaving
Britain trailing by 0.2secs after the first lap.


Their lead grew slightly over the next two laps before they
finished in a winning time of 43.830sec, leaving the all-Scottish
trio of Craig MacLean, Ross Edgar and Chris Hoy with the silver
medal.


Hoy produced a blazing final lap to close the gap slightly but it
was not to be for the trio who combined successfully to win the
Commonwealth title in Melbourne last year.


It is the second year in a row France has beaten Great Britain in
the tough three-man event. Last year the same French team beat
MacLean, Englishman Jamie Staff and Hoy.
