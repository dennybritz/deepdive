Spanish prosecutors plan to push for a ban on a new political
party created by Basque separatist group ETA's political wing, a
justice official said Thursday.


Batasuna, the banned political wing, said earlier this week it
had created a new political party to contest May local elections.


Prosecutors' request to ban the party will be filed with the
country's supreme court, which examines the legality of new
parties.


The request is not a surprise. Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodiguez Zapatero has already said the party appeared illegal and
the government was unlikely to authorise it.


Prosecutors plan to argue that the new party is simply Batasuna
with a new name.


The government has said Batasuna cannot take part in elections
unless it breaks definitively with ETA's armed campaign.


Batasuna, while it has distanced itself from the armed struggle,
has yet to make the unequivocal statement the government is
seeking.


The armed Basque separatist movement is blamed for 819 deaths in
its 38-year campaign to win independence for the region.


If its party is banned, Batasuna may still manage to present
candidates in the May 27 elections. The group is considering
urging candidates to run who are not officially affiliated with
Batasuna, but who are sympathetic to its cause, Spanish daily ABC
has reported.


The name of the new party is Abertzale Sozialisten Batasuna
(Socialist Patriotic Unity).
