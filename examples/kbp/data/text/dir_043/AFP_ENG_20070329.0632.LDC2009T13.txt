Iran will examine "in a positive way" a Turkish request to free
the sole woman among 15 British military personnel held in Iran,
Iranian state television quoted President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as
saying on Thursday.


"Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked for the
Turkish ambassador to be able to visit the 15 British sailors ...
and asked President Ahmadinejad to free the only woman British
sailor through Islamic kindness," the channel reported.


"The president, while saying that because of the bad attitude of
the British government this dossier has taken a judicial path,
has given the order for the Turkish request to be examined in a
positive way," it said, in apparent reference to the request to
free the woman sailor, Faye Turney.
