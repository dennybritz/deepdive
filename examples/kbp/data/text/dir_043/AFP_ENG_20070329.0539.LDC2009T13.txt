Arsenal striker Robin van Persie is likely to miss the rest of
the season as he struggles to recover from the foot injury he
suffered against Manchester United in January.


Van Persie has been sidelined since breaking the fifth metatarsal
in his right foot while celebrating scoring against United at the
Emirates Stadium and Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has confirmed
he does not expect the Dutch star back this season.


It had been thought van Persie might be fit for the final matches
of the season but, with Arsenal having only a top-four finish in
the Premiership to play for, he won't be rushed back.


"The end of April now looks optimistic," Wenger told Arsenal TV
Online on Thursday. "It is likely he will be out for the season.


"We have spoken to the doctors and they told us that the longer
you keep this kind of fracture without playing the less chance
you have of a recurrence. So if he can play only one or two games
then we will not take a gamble."
