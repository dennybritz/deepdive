Luxembourg-based real estate development and hotel group, Orco
Property Group, Thursday announced a 77.0 percent increase in
2006 net profit to 96.7 million euros (129.0 million dollars) on
the back of a strong performance from its property development
arm.


Earnings from property development rose to 124.3 million euros,
compared with 21.9 million a year earlier, the company, which is
quoted on the Prague and Paris stock exchanges, said in a news
release.


Income from the hotel division climbed to 30.8 million euros from
21.9 million a year earlier with overall 2006 group revenue
trebling to 172.9 million euros, the company added.


Orco said it would recommend a 25.0 percent increase in the
dividend to 1.0 euro per share.


The group said it purchased real estate assets for 425 million
euros in 2006, taking its total portfolio value to over 1.3
billion euros.


"The year 2007 has started sucessfully and full of new
challenges," Orco said.


The company was poised to complete its second real estate
acquisition in Russia, where it wants to repeat the same
expansion it has piloted in Central Europe, it added.


The launch of Orco shares on the Budapest and Warsaw stock
exchanges should take place within the next weeks, it said.
