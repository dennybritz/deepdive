Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins cruised to victory in the men's
individual pursuit final here at the world track cycling
championships on Thursday.


Wiggins, who last won the crown on his last visit to the world
championships at Stuttgart in 2003, beat defending champion
Robert Bartko of Germany with relative ease in the 16-lap event.


Spanish veteran Sergi Escobar beat his compatriot Antonio Tauler
to take the bronze medal.


Wiggins had scorched his way into the final earlier in the day
setting a time of 4:15.976 - four seconds faster than Bartko.


However the 26-year-old Englishman, who has only recently
returned to track cycling with a view to defending his crown at
the Beijing Olympics in 2008, had to race for just under three
minutes before catching up with his German rival.


That signalled the end of the race.


Britain are also hoping to win gold Thursday in the men's and
women's team sprint finals.
