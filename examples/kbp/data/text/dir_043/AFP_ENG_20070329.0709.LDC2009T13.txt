Japan's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.0 percent in
February as expected, official data showed Friday.


The total number of unemployed dipped by 70,000 from a year
earlier to 2.7 million in February, the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications said.


The unemployment rate is watched closely for evidence of expanded
hiring by Japanese companies and positive knock-on effects for
consumer spending.
