The British woman sailor Faye Turney captured by Iran said UK
troops should leave Iraq, according to a letter published on
Thursday by the official Iranian news agency IRNA.


"Isn't it time to start withdrawing our forces from Iraq and let
them determine their own future?" Turney was quoted as saying in
the letter to her member of parliament, which IRNA only published
in Farsi.
