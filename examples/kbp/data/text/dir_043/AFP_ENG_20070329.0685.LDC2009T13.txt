Computer giant Dell said Thursday an internal review of its
accounting practices had uncovered errors, deficiencies and
"evidence of misconduct" in the reporting of its finances.


Dell said in a statement it was delaying the filing of its annual
report with US stock market regulators to continue the probe.


Dell had already asked for a delay of its 10-K report to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its fiscal
year ended February 2 beyond the prescribed due date of April 3.


The Texas-based firm said a board-appointed audit committee was
continuing its investigation "into certain accounting and
financial reporting matters," without elaborating.


"As we move toward the conclusion of our investigation, we are
committing the time and resources required to ensure a thorough
and comprehensive review and resolution of all identified issues
and the implementation of appropriate remedial measures," said
Thomas Luce, chair of Dell's audit committee.


The panel "has identified a number of accounting errors, evidence
of misconduct, and deficiencies in the financial control
environment," the company statement said.


"The audit committee is working with management and the company's
independent auditors to determine whether the accounting errors
necessitate any restatements of prior period financial
statements, and to assess whether the control deficiencies
constitute a material weakness in Dell's internal control over
financial reporting."


Dell said last year its accounting was the object of an "informal
investigation" by the SEC.
