A new letter attributed to female British detainee in Iran, Faye
Turney, questions why British forces are still in Iraq, Sky News
reported on Thursday citing details of the document.


The letter, reportedly sent to her local member of parliament in
London, also reiterates that Turney and 14 other British sailors
and marines were in Iranian waters when seized last Friday.


"Unfortunately during the course of our mission we entered into
Iranian waters," said the letter, which Sky said it had obtained
from Iranian authorities, although it could not verify its
authenticity.


"Even through our wrongdoing they have still treated us well and
humanely, which I am and always will be enternally grateful" for,
it said.


"I ask the representatives of the House of Commons, after the
government had promised that this type of incident would not
happen again: why have they let this occur, and why have the
government not been questioned over this?"


And it continued: "Isn't it time to start withdrawing our forces
from Iraq and let them determine their own future?"


The letter was in the same handwriting as one released by Iran's
embassy to London Wednesday, in which the 26-year-old said the
sailors and marines had "apparently" strayed into Iranian waters
when seized.


After that letter and an accompanying video British authorities
issued a statement voicing concern over coercion.
