Guinea-Bissau Prime Minister Aristide Gomes said on Thursday that
he had tendered his resignation and that of his government
following the loss of a confidence vote on March 19.


"I presented yesterday (Wednesday) to the president of the
republic a letter of resignation of my government. We are waiting
for his reaction. If the president renews his confidence in me, I
am ready to come back," Gomes said.


Gomes's government lost the vote 54 to 28 amid criticism over
government spending and for failing to resolve a crisis over the
payment of several months' salary owed to civil servants.


The loss of the vote was a further blow to President Joao
Bernardo Vieira, who has struggled to govern in the impoverished
west African country since returning to power in 2005.


Vieira was overthrown from power in 1999 after 19 years of iron-
fisted rule, but returned from exile in former colonial power
Portugal to run for the presidency as an independent.


Gomes told a news conference that the political situation was
"very unfavourable" for him and blamed the opposition party of
2000-2003 president Kumba Yala, currently in exile in Morocco,
for the instability.
