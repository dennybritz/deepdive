Andy Roddick's pulled left hamstring might keep him from playing
in next week's Davis Cup quarter-final and his status might not
be known until Sunday, US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe said.


Roddick retired in the first set of a quarter-final match at the
ATP Masters Series event in Miami on Wednesday with pain in his
left rear and an MRI exam showed it was a strained hamstring
rather than a tear.


"Andy tweaked a hamstring in the upper left part of his leg,"
McEnroe said. "The good news at least is that it is not torn, but
it is a hamstring so that is kind of tricky."


Roddick and eighth-ranked James Blake are scheduled to face Spain
next weekend at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Spaniards will
be without Rafael Nadal, who is struggling with a foot injury. He
also lost Wednesday at Miami.


"We'll have a better idea in about three days how he has come
up," McEnroe said. "The problem is that it is not the sort of
injury that you can't sort of play through.


"It will either heal quickly and he'll be able to practice for a
few days and be able to go or he won't and we obviously will have
to go to plan B, but he is certainly he is going to do everything
in his power to play next week."
