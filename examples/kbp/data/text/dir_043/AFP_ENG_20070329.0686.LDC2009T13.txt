The UN Security Council on Thursday adopted a watered-down
statement expressing "grave concern" at the continued detention
of 15 British sailors by Iran and urged Tehran to permit consular
access to them.


South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo, who chairs the
15-member body for this month, read out a non-binding statement
saying that council members "expressed grave concern at the
capture and continued detention" of the British sailors, while
calling on Tehran to allow "consular access" to them.
