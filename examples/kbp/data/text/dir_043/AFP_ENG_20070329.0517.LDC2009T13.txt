African leaders called on South African President Thabo Mbeki to
head efforts to promote dialogue between rival political parties
in Zimbabwe, the Tanzanian president said here on Thursday.


"The decision has been to promote dialogue of parties in
Zimbabwe. There is no replacement for that," Jakaya Kikwete told
journalists at the end of a summit of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC).


"The decision has to be to entrust President (Thabo) Mbeki to
lead the process of dialogue in Zimbabwe."
