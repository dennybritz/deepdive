Indy-car rookie racer Pablo Perez of Argentina was in stable
condition here Thursday after reconstructive surgery on his lower
legs, Indy Racing League officials announced.


Perez, who suffered severe leg injuries in a crash during a
developmental series race last Saturday, was transferred here
Tuesday from Miami and underwent his third surgery since the
accident late Wednesday.


The 24-year-old race was hurt in a multi-car accident on lap 47
of the Miami 100, the first race of the year for the open-wheel
secondary series. He underwent surgery Saturday and again Monday
in Florida.


Kevin Scheid, the IRL orthopedic consultant at Methodist
Hospital, has planned additional reconstructive surgeries before
an extensive rehabilitation program for Perez but no specific
timetable has been scheduled.
