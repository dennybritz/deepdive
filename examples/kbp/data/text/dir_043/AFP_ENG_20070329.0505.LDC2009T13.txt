Sweden will extradite a Moroccan man suspected of plotting
terrorist attacks to Germany, where a European warrant had been
issued for his arrest, Swedish officials said on Thursday.


German justice officials had ordered 24 year-old Abdelali Miftah
remanded in custody in absentia, "as part of an inquiry in
Germany on terrorist crimes," prosecutor Ronnie Jacobsson told
AFP.


He said Miftah is suspected of participating in preparations to
commit terrorist attacks but gave no further details.


Miftah was arrested in Sweden several weeks ago because he had no
residency permit but was released. On Monday, after receiving the
German warrant, Swedish police arrested him again. On Thursday,
he was remanded in custody.


Jacobsson said Morocco had also issued a warrant for Miftah's
arrest, but this was not sufficient for authorities in Sweden to
act.


Miftah can appeal his extradition to Germany.


According to Swedish news agency TT, Swedish authorities also
decided Wednesday to remand in custody and extradite a Jordanian
man to Germany.


He is suspected of having links to Miftah and a third person
detained in Germany.
