Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki received treatment for his
sore left ankle here Thursday but his status for Friday's
National Basketball Association game at New York remained
uncertain.


The German superstar, a strong candidate for National Basketball
Association Most Valuable Player honors this year, suffered the
injury during the second quarter of the Mavericks' 105-103
triumph over Milwaukee on Wednesday.


Nowitzki departed with 3:42 remaining in the first half and tried
to start the third quarter but was quickly benched and did not
return to the game.


A statement from the Mavericks said Nowitzki's status would be
decided after Friday's game-day shootaround. While the 7-footer
has a history of ankle woes, he has missed only one game this
season, benched on December 31 at Denver by a sinus infection.


Nowitzki, in his ninth NBA season, has led the Mavericks to a
league-best 60-11 record. He ranks 10th in the NBA in scoring
with 24.9 points and 15th in rebounding at 9.3 per game.


His 47 percent accuracy rate includes 38 percent success from
3-point range.
