South African lawmakers voted through legislation on Thursday
making it harder for smokers to indulge their habit in the open
air, at home or in their cars.


An amendment bill makes it an offence to smoke within a
prescribed distance from a window, ventilation inlet, doorway or
entrance to a public place -- and introduces a fine of 500 rand
(about 70 dollars) for breaches.


It also bans smoking in a private dwelling used for commercial
childcare, tutoring or schooling, and in any car carrying a child
who is younger than 12.


South Africa already has wide-ranging legislation banning smoking
inside public buildings and parts of restaurants, but the new
bill aims to tighten perceived loopholes.


Employers who fail to protect non-smokers in the workplace would
be liable for a fine of up to 100,000 rand, a ten-fold increase
on the previous penalty.


"Millions of people, including one half of the world's children,
are exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke," deputy health minister
Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge told MPs as she introduced the bill.


"There is conclusive evidence linking passive smoking to an
increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer and other
respiratory diseases."


The bill prohibits anyone under 18s from entering a designated
smoking area and bans "misleading labelling" on packets,
including words such as "light" and "mild".
