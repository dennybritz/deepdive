Britain must recognise a violation of Iranian waters by its 15
sailors if it wants to help resolve the crisis, said Iran's
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking on state television
on Thursday.


"They (British leaders) must accept that this violation took
place, that would help to resolve the affair," said Mottaki.


The minister added that consular access to the 15 would not be
given until Iran had finished its investigations


"Twice, a request for consular visit has been submitted. They
(consular officials) will be able to meet them after
investigation finish," said Mottaki.


The 15 sailors, who include one woman, were seized on March 23 by
Iranian forces in the Gulf. Tehran said the Britons were captured
in Iranian waters while London says they were around 1.7 nautical
miles inside Iraqi waters, carrying out routine anti-smuggling
patrols.
