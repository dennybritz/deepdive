US conductor John Nelson is to quit as musical director of the
Ensemble Orchestral de Paris (EOP) at the end of the 2007-2008
season after a decade, the orchestra said on Thursday.


"The 10 years spent with the Ensemble Orchestral de Paris were
among the happiest and most motivating of my entire life," the 65
-year-old said in a statement in French.


Nelson joined the "Mannheim"-style orchestra of 43 musicians,
midway between a symphony and a chamber orchestra, in 1998.


Born in Costa Rica, he is a versatile and accomplished conductor
who began at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1973 but also
conducts church music at the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.


Known for his own homage to Berlioz, he and the EOP recently
became the first Paris orchestra in several decades to record all
the Beethoven symphonies.
