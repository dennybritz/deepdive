Despite a move to a new team and a new league, oft-injured
pitcher Eric Gagne will start the 2007 Major League Baseball
season in familiar territory: on the disabled list.


The Texas Rangers announced Thursday on their official website
that the Gagne will start the regular season on the 15-day
disabled list.


Gagne, a three-time All-Star closer, has been ravaged by a series
of injuries over the past two seasons and still is recovering
from numerous operations on his shoulder, elbow and back.


Signed to a one-year deal reportedly worth six million dollars in
incentives in December, the 31-year-old Gagne has worked just
three innings this spring, allowing five runs and three hits.


The Rangers apparently feel Gagne needs more work before the
season.


"He's feeling great," Rangers pitching coach Mark Connor told the
website.  "He just needs to pitch more innings."


The 2003 National League Cy Young Award winner, Gagne owns a
record of 25-21 with a 3.27 ERA in 298 career games - all but 48
in relief - with the Los Angeles Dodgers.


The major league record holder with 84 consecutive saves
converted from August 28, 2002-July 3, 2004, Gagne has recorded
161 lifetime saves - including a career-high 55 in 2003, when he
posted a 1.20 ERA in 77 games.
