A new private airline in Gabon has scheduled its first flight for
April 10, a company official said on Thursday.


The Gabon Airlines flight will travel from Paris' Charles de
Gaulle airport to the Gabon capital of Libreville, then return
the next day, said Jocelyne Bonnal, sales director for the
company.


The Boeing 767 flight is equipped to carry 156 passengers,
including 37 in first or business classes.


Currently, only Air France flies direct between France and Gabon.
The new airline plans three roundtrip flights per week on that
route.


The company, which has purchased two Boeing 767s from US-based
United Airlines, plans to begin routes to Johannesburg by the end
of May. Flights to Abidjan, Lagos and Dakar are to follow.


It is also negotiating the purchase of Boeing 737s, with plans to
fly to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo and Angola by the end
of the year.


The company was founded by Christian Bongo, a son of Gabon
President Omar Bongo Ondimba. It has obtained the air traffic
rights and privileges that had previously belonged to the now-
defunct state company Air Gabon.
