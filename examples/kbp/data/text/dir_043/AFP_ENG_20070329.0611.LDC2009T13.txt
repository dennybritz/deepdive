The British woman sailor Faye Turney captured by Iran said UK
troops should leave Iraq, according to a letter published on
Thursday by the official Iranian news agency IRNA.


"Isn't it time to start withdrawing our forces from Iraq and let
them determine their own future?" Turney was quoted as saying in
the letter to her member of parliament, which IRNA only published
in Farsi.


IRNA also quoted an Iranian official as saying the Islamic
republic had lodged a protest over the alleged incursion into its
territorial waters by Turney and 14 other British sailors and
marines, all currently held by Iran.


"Iran on Thursday summoned the British ambassador to lodge an
official protest regarding the violation of its territorial
waters by the British sailors," the official was quoted as
saying, requesting anonymity.


"During the meeting the British ambassador was told that media
and political rumpus don't help solve problems but only make them
more complicated," the official said.
