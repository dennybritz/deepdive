British Prime Minister Tony Blair renewed Thursday a vow to
bolster pressure on Iran over its seizure of 15 navy personnel,
calling the broadcast of footage of a female detainee a
"disgrace."


"What we have to do in a very firm way, is step up the pressure,"
he told ITV television.


"The important thing is we just keep making it very, very clear
to the Iranian government it is not a situation that will be
relieved by anything but the unconditional release of all our
people," he added.
