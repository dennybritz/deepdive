World number one Justine Henin of Belgium downed Russian Anna
Chakvetadze 6-2, 6-3 to reach the women's final of the 6.9
million-dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series hardcourt tournament
here Thursday.


Henin, in quest of her 32nd career title and third in a row after
crowns in Dubai and Doha, will face the winner of a later semi-
final between Australian Open champion Serena Williams and
Israel's Shahar Peer for the championship.


Henin, the reigning French Open champion, has not faced Williams
since beating the US star in a 2003 Wimbledon semi-final. Henin
has a 5-3 edge on Williams in their career rivalry.


The final two men's semi-final berths will also be settled later
Thursday when Croatian seventh seed Ivan Ljubicic meets
Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela and Spanish sixth seed Tommy
Robredo meets Argentina's Guillermo Canas.


Canas played the giant-killer role for the second ATP event in a
row, ousting world number one Roger Federer earlier this week
after having ended his 41-match win streak earlier this month at
Indian Wells, California.


The other men's semi-final is already set. Serbian Novak
Djokovic, who upset second-seeded Spaniard Rafael Nadal 6-3, 6-4
Wednesday, will face Scotsman Andy Murray in a battle of 19-year-
old prodigies.
