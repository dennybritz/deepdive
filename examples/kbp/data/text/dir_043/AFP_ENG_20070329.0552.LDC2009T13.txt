Two suicide bombers killed 60 people on Thursday when they blew
themselves up in a Baghdad market, security officials said, in
the deadliest attack since the start of a security crackdown in
the Iraqi capital.


The bombers detonated their explosive vests at around 6:30 pm
(1530 GMT) in the popular Shallal market in northeast Baghdad's
Al-Shaab district.


"At least two terrorists blew themselves up in the middle of a
people's market, in the Shaab district, killing at least 60
people and wounding 25," a police source said.


A military source confirmed the death toll.


The latest bomb attacks came after a string of bombings and
mortar attacks which killed another 43 people, this time in the
restive Shiite town of Khalis, north of Baghdad.


Insurgents and armed gangs have unleashed a deadly bout of
violence in the past three days in Iraq, killing more than 300
people.


The worst bout of sectarian violence was on Tuesday when gunmen,
alleged to be police, went on a rampage in the northern town of
Tal Afar killing 70 Sunni Arabs after a presumed Sunni bomber
blew up a truck in a crowd of mostly Shiites.


The truck bombing killed at least 85 people.
