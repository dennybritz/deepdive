Russia on Thursday opposed a British call in the UN Security
Council for the immediate release of 15 British sailors held by
Iran, a Western diplomat said.


"We will not be able to accept a call for the immediate release
of the 15 UK naval personnel," Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin
said during the closed-door consultations, according to the
Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
