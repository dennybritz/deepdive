Britain must recognise a violation of Iranian waters by its 15
sailors if it wants to help resolve the crisis, said Iran's
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, speaking on state television
on Thursday.


"They (British leaders) must accept that this violation took
place, that would help to resolve the affair," said Mottaki.
