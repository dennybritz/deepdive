When England and Ireland go head-to-head here on Friday in a
World Cup Super Eights clash, former team-mates Ed Joyce and
Niall O'Brien will have key roles to play.


Joyce helped Ireland qualify for the World Cup with 399 runs in
five ICC Trophy matches back in 2005, but changed allegiance and
is now playing for England.


Joyce admitted he may face some verbal jousting from fiesty
Ireland wicket- keeper O'Brien.


"He (O'Brien) does that from behind the stumps, I remember,"
Joyce said on Wednesday.


Joyce's passing of useful information onto Irish players to his
English teammates may also not go down well with his former
colleagues.


O'Brien, who like Joyce has also shown an interest in making a
career with England, has old rivalries with Joyce who played with
Middlesex while O'Brien initially played for Kent before
switching to Northamptonshire in the English county championship.


Both have been performing well in their first World Cup
appearances.


O'Brien kept one end intact during Ireland's three-wicket upset
win over former champions Pakistan in the first round, hitting a
gutsy 72.


Joyce has been England's mainstay and after failing against New
Zealand came up with two half-centuries against Canada and Kenya.


While Joyce looks cool and calm, O'Brien confesses to playing his
cricket hard.


"I am a fiery character. I play aggressive cricket. That's part
of my game. If I wasn't you'd be taking away 50 percent of the
player I am."
