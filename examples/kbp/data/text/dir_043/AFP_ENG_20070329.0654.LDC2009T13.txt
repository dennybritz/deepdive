At least one person died Thursday following clashes between
supporters of two rival political parties in northern Nigeria,
the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported.


Several others were injured when supporters of the ruling
People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Nigeria People's
Party (ANPP) clashed in Bauchi city, capital of Bauchi State,
police spokesman Alasan Guja said.


Other sources put the death toll at three, NAN reported without
giving further details.


The clashes, which spread to other cities in the province,
followed a row over the removal of election candidates' posters,
the news agency said.


About 500 policemen had been deployed to the affected areas, Guja
said.


Tensions are rising in Nigeria ahead of next month's crucial vote
to choose a successor to President Olusegun Obasanjo, who steps
down after 16 years in power on May 29.
