The owner of a hot dog joint in Chicago paid 250 dollars Thursday
for violating the city's controversial ban on the sale of foie
gras, the first time the city has fully enforced the edict.


"This being the first offence, the officer set the fine at 250
dollars, which is the minimum under the ordinance," said Tim
Hadac, a spokesman for the city's department of public health.


Doug Sohn, owner of Hot Doug's, a gourmet hot dog and sausage
spot, was represented at the hearing by his lawyer and did not
seem unduly worried by the fine.


"I certainly brought this upon myself," said Sohn, who admitted
going out of his way to test the city's commitment to a ban which
Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley himself has called the "silliest"
bylaw ever passed by the city council.


"I was sort of poking and prodding to see how seriously the law
was going to be taken. I wanted to see how far they would take
it," Sohn explained.


Health department officials have cited a dozen restaurants and
delicatessens in this Midwest city since the prohibition became
effective in August of 2006. A first offense merits a warning,
and a second earns the offender a fine, which can range up to 500
dollars.


A city alderman sponsored the ban on the grounds that force-
feeding ducks and geese to fatten their livers is tantamount to
animal cruelty.


Foie gras -- French for fatty liver -- is commonly produced by
force-feeding ducks and geese so their livers become engorged and
expand up to 10 times the normal size.
