Police using tear gas and water cannon on Thursday arrested at
least 150 demonstrators demanding better public transit, Santiago
governor Adriana Delpiano said.


Students were protesting on the annual "Day of the Young
Fighter," which commemorates the 1985 police killings of two
students during the regime of late dictator Augusto Pinochet.


The commemoration was elevated this year by public dismay over
Santiago's reorganized public bus system, which users say causes
undue waiting at stops.


Police deployed 4,000 officers and a dozen armored personnel
carriers around the city for the event.


Some hooded protestors threw Molotov cocktails in the south of
Santiago, and the capital's universities closed early Thursday to
prevent a spillover of the protests onto their campuses.


Delpiano said many of those arrested were university students,
while earlier Thursday Interior Minister Belisario Velasco said
police had arrested 68 students, 76 of whom were minors.


Students launched the first protest of President Michelle
Bachelet's term last year by demanding free student access to
public transportation.
