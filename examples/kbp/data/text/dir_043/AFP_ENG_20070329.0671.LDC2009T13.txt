US software colossus Microsoft on Thursday unveiled a prototype
of a mobile Internet browser designed to mirror the ease of going
online via a desktop computer.


"Think about your mobile browsing experience today," said
Microsoft Live Labs director Gary William Flake.


"It's often less than intuitive, the pages don't look like what
you've come to expect on the desktop, and it takes a long time
for a page to load. Deepfish aims to solve that problem."


Instead of relying on websites being tailored for mobile devices,
Deepfish captures and delivers "as-designed" views of online
pages of all kinds, according to Microsoft.


Users can also zoom in or out on sections of web pages.


"All of this adds up to an easier and faster way to navigate
through a page," Flake said.


Microsoft said it is releasing a Deepfish prototype to get
feedback from users and that it remained to be determined when a
final version might be rolled out for the public.


The company said the Deepfish technology is available for public
preview on a limited, first-come first-served basis at the
website http://labs.live.com/deepfish/.


The announcement came as US Internet search titans vie for the
devotion of mobile Internet users in a mushrooming market.


Google made a new mobile search engine available to the public on
Tuesday, the same day that rival Yahoo enticed website publishers
to enhance the "oneSearch" mobile search engine it released early
this year.
