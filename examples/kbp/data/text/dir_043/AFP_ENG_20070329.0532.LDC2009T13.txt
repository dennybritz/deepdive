MySpace announced on Thursday that it will host a mystery series
titled 'Prom Queen' produced in 90-second snippets by former Walt
Disney studio head Michael Eisner.


The episodes were made by Eisner's independent multimedia studio
Vuguru, and will launch April 1 at the MySpace website
http://myspace.com/promqueentv.


"Prom Queen has the potential to be a break-out hit on MySpace,"
said Chris DeWolfe, co-founder of the teen-oriented social
networking website now owned by News Corp.


"Video is a cultural cornerstone for the MySpace community; it's
a huge part of how our users express themselves and discover pop
culture."


'Prom Queen' will play out over 80 episodes, with a new episode
appearing daily after the Sunday premier.


MySpace said it will provide extra show-related content such as
character "diaries," storyline tips, and behind-the-scenes video
clips.


The 'Prom Queen' story follows a group of friends in their final
two months of high school.


"With this partnership, the future of on-line story telling is
now," Eisner said in a statement.
