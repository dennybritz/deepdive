The Palestinian government's advisor for national security
arrived in Cairo on Thursday in the wake of a US official's
announcement that Israelis and Palestinians would meet there for
security talks.


Egypt's official MENA news agency said Mohammed Dahlan had
arrived in the Egyptian capital for talks with "officials in
Egypt" about the results of the Arab League summit in Riyadh and
its decision to relaunch the long dormant Arab peace initiative.


On Tuesday, a US official accompanying Secretary of State
Condoleeza Rice back from her trip to the region said that
Israeli and Palestinian officials, together with US and Egyptian
representatives, would meet in two days timd in Cairo to discuss
security issues.


A first meeting of the "quadrilateral security committee" was
organized following Rice's previous trip to the region in
February to develop a security plan for forces loyal to the
moderate Palestinian president, Mahmud Abbas.
