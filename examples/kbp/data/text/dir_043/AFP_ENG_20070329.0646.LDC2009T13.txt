Oscar-winning British actress Helen Mirren is to play Nicolas
Cage's mum in the sequel to his 2004 box office hit "National
Treasure," the industry press said Thursday.


Mirren, fresh from scooping the best actress award at this year's
Oscars for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in "The Queen",
will take the role of the mother of Benjamin Gates, played by
Cage.


The new romp entitled "National Treasure: Book of Secrets" has
Gates seeking to unlock the truth behind the 1865 assassination
of US president Abraham Lincoln, Variety magazine said.


Other stars signed up for the Disney family flick include Ed
Harris, Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel.


"National Treasure," which came out in 2004, was one of the top
10 films of the year at the US box office, raking in some 173
million dollars, and picking up a similar amount abroad.
