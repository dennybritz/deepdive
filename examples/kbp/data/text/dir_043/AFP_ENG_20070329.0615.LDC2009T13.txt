British duo Shanaze Reade and Victoria Pendelton combined to win
the women's team sprint crown, being held for the first time here
at the world track cycling championships on Thursday.


The Englishwomen had a comparatively slower start than Dutch
rivals Yvonne Hijgenaar and Willy Kanis but pulled slightly ahead
by the halfway point to finish in a winning time of 33.631 secs.


The Dutch pair finished in 33.974.


Australia took the bronze medal ahead of France.


The women's team sprint event, which has only two riders as
opposed to three for the men, is not an Olympic event.
