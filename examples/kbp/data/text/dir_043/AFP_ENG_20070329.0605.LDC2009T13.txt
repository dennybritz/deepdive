Two-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan shrugged off jetlag as
he came from two frames down against Ali Carter to reach the
China Open quarter-finals 5-4 on Thursday.


O'Sullivan, a double winner here, was struggling at 2-4 down
before taking the final three frames to set up a last-eight
meeting with Marco Fu, who beat Matthew Stevens 5-3.


"I've not slept for 24 hours, so maybe I was a bit loose. But the
more chances I missed, the more confident I got," said
O'Sullivan, nicknamed 'The Rocket.'


"It was hard out there, it was a difficult match, but I had good
support from the crowd, which is nice."


Hong Kong's Fu, Stephen Hendry's conqueror in the opening round,
knocked in three half-century breaks to come from 2-0 down
against Stevens and maintain Asian interest in the competition.


Scotland's John Higgins beat Jimmy White 5-1 to set up a quarter-
final with Graeme Dott.


Barry Hawkins will play Ken Doherty in the last eight after
Hawkins beat Joe Swail 5-0, while Jamie Cope will take on Shaun
Murphy, who beat Stephen Maguire 5-2.
