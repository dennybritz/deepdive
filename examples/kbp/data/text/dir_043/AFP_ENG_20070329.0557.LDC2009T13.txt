India on Thursday slapped a ban on French satellite channel
Fashion TV for broadcasting programmes which it said were not in
"good taste," the government announced.


"The channel has been banned for showing programmes that are
against good taste and decency, denigrate women and are likely to
adversely affect public morality," the Information and
Broadcasting Ministry said.


The ministry said the ban beginning April 1 would be for two
months. The channel was first stopped from broadcasting in
February 2002 for the display of too much female flesh in
conservative India.


In January, India blacked out Sony's satellite channel AXN for a
similar period for showing "indecent content." The ban was lifted
after the network apologised.
