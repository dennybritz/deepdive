Eddie House, the most accurate 3-point shooter for the New Jersey
Nets, is sidelined indefinitely after a concussion and torn left
hip muscle, the team announced Thursday.


The Nets are fighting for a National Basketball Association
playoff berth and losing reserve guard House, who averages 8.4
points and 1.2 assists while hitting 42.9 percent from beyond the
arc, will hurt their post-season bid.


At 33-38, the Nets are seventh in the Eastern Conference and only
one-half game ahead of Orlando for the last playoff spot with
Indiana and New York, both 31-40, trying to chase both clubs down
to capture a playoff spot.


House, 28, suffered the injuries in the second quarter of
Wednesday's 118-94 victory over Indiana, taking a hard foul from
the Pacers' David Harrison as he ran for the basket.
