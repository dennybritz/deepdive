Wall Street shares ended mostly higher Thursday after an upward
revision to US economic growth helped ease fears about a slowdown
and prompted bargain hunting a day after a big selloff.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 45.26 points (0.37
percent) to 12,345.62 at the closing bell, after a strong open
faded in mid-session before a rally into the close.


The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite rose a fractional 0.65 points
(0.03 percent) at 2,417.75 and the broad-market Standard and
Poor's 500 increased 4.98 points (0.35 percent) to a provisional
close of 1,422.21.


Ahead of the opening, the US government released data showing the
US economy grew at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter, a
bit faster than earlier estimates.


This helped spark a rebound from Wednesday's selloff, when
markets were jittery about Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke's
remarks about "uncertainties" in the US housing market and
uncomfortably high inflation.


"This revision is minor, but serves as a reminder that economic
growth is right at the sweet spot for the Fed's desired soft
landing," said Dick Green at Briefing.com.


"Growth is slightly below long-term potential of 3.0 percent to
an extent that will ease inflationary pressures over time, but
not so weak as to cause significant economic dislocations."


Keeping a lid on gains was a jump in oil prices.  New York's main
oil futures contract, light sweet crude for delivery in May,
surged 1.95 dollars to close at 66.03 dollars a barrel, topping
the 66-dollar mark for the first time since last September.
