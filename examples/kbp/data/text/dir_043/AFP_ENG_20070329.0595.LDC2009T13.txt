Czech environment minister and Green Party leader, Martin Bursik,
said on Thursday that his country would propose changes to EU
rules aimed at allowing member states to ban nearly all cross
border transport of waste.


"We do not want a general ban on the European transport of waste
but we want to give member states the right to decide themselves
whether to partially or fully limit the export of waste," Bursik
said after a meeting with his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel.


Sorted waste, such as paper and glass, for recyling, should not
be covered by the proposed move, Bursik added.


Bursik's move is aimed at preventing rich EU countries using
poorer member states as a dustbin for their waste. The Czech
Republic was flooded with thousands of tonnes of illegally dumped
German waste last year after Berlin tightened its rules on waste
recycling and processing.


Prague fears that rubbish from rich countries could exploit
loopholes in current EU rules by crossing the border as waste for
burning in incinerators.


Bursik said he would seek support for his initiative to revise
the EU's framework directive on waste from Slovakia, Hungary and
Poland.


Gabriel said that EU countries were divided on how to rewrite the
EU's waste rules. Germany currently holds the presidency of the
EU's council of ministers with Gabriel hoping to hammer out a
deal on the revised waste rules by the end of June.
