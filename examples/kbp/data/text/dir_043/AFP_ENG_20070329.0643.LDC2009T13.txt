British duo Shanaze Reade and Victoria Pendleton combined to win
the women's team sprint crown, being held for the first time here
at the world track cycling championships on Thursday.


The Englishwomen had a comparatively slower start than Dutch
rivals Yvonne Hijgenaar and Willy Kanis but pulled slightly ahead
by the halfway point to finish in a winning time of 33.631 secs.


The Dutch pair finished in 33.974.


Australia took the bronze medal ahead of France.


The women's team sprint event, which has only two riders as
opposed to three for the men, is not an Olympic event.


However that did not stop Pendleton and Reade, an 18-year-old who
came to track through BMX and has only been riding track for a
few months, savouring their first world title together.


"It's great, especially as we've become the first world champions
in the event," said Pendleton, who on Saturday is expected to
battle for the women's sprint crown she last won in 2005.


On Saturday, Pendleton will aim to go better than her second
place finish last year in Bordeaux, but she admits it will be
tough.


"It's terrible," she said of the sprint event, in which the
riders face off in a duel for three laps of cat and mouse before
bursting as fast as they can for the finish line.


"It's the worst event in the world as far as pressure is
concerned. It's a one- on-one battle all day."
