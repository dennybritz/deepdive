Britain confirmed on Friday that its embassy in Tehran had
received a "formal note" from the Iranian government, but
declined to provide details about the message.


Britain earlier failed to secure strong UN Security Council
support for its row with Tehran over the capture and ongoing
detention of 15 British sailors.


"We can confirm that ... the Iranian government has sent a formal
note to the British embassy," a foreign ministry spokeswoman told
AFP.


"Such exchanges are always confidential, so we cannot divulge any
details. But we are giving the message serious consideration, and
will soon respond formally to the Iranian government."


The spokeswoman declined to comment on the content of the note,
or on when it was received.


The UN Security Council adopted a watered-down statement
expressing "grave concern" at the detention of the sailors and
marines but stopped well short of London's call for censuring
Tehran.


Britain had sought a tougher stance against the Iranians, who
seized the 15 Britons, including a female sailor, last Friday in
two boats during what London claims were anti-smuggling
operations in Iraqi waters.
