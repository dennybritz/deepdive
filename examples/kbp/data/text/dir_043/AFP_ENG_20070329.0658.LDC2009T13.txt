Rubber-faced actor Jim Carrey is to return to his roots, signing
to play in the comedy "Me Time" after an attempt at a serious
role fizzled at the box office, Variety reported Thursday.


Carrey, who won fame with his roles in "The Mask" and "Ace
Ventura: Pet Detective," will play an author writing a book about
his great great-grandmother who is shocked by what he discovers
in her diary.


Another Carrey project which had been put on hold, "Ripley's
Believe It or Not," is also back on track, the industry journal
said.


Carrey's last film "The Number 23," bombed at the box-office,
only pulling in some 35 million dollars, far from the 240 million
dollars racked up by his 2003 comedy "Bruce Almighty."
