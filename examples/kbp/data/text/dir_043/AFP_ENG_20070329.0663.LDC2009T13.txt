Former "American Idol" contestant Jennifer Hudson, who scooped an
Oscar for "Dreamgirls," her very first movie, is in talks on a
new film role, reports said Thursday.


Hollywood Reporter said Hudson was in negotiations for a part in
"Winged Creatures," about a group of strangers who form a unique
relationship with each other after surviving a random shooting at
a Los Angeles diner.


Hudson, who first came to prominence as a contestant on the
smash-hit US reality show "American Idol," could star in her
second-ever movie role alongside Forest Whitaker, who won the
best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Idi Amin in "The Last King
of Scotland."


Hudson won the Oscar for best supporting actress earlier this
year for her performance as Effie Melody White in the uplifting
musical "Dreamgirls," which charts the rise of a 1960s soul
group.
