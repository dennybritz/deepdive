Japan's core consumer prices fell by 0.1 percent in February from
a year earlier, the first decline for 10 months as the economy
struggles to shake off deflation, official figures showed Friday.


The core consumer price index (CPI) for Tokyo alone -- the
leading indicator for national price trends -- dropped by 0.1
percent in March from a year earlier, the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications said.


The return to negative core inflation -- which had been expected
by economists after a cooling of world oil prices -- came as the
Bank of Japan raised its super low interest rates to 0.5 percent
last month.
