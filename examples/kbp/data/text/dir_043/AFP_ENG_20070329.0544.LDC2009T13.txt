Two suicide bombers killed 60 people on Thursday when they blew
themselves up in a Baghdad market, security officials said, in
the deadliest attack since the start of a security crackdown in
the Iraqi capital.


The bombers detonated their explosive vests at around 6:30 pm
(1530 GMT) in the popular Shallal market in northeast Baghdad's
Al-Shaab district.


Another 25 people were wounded.
