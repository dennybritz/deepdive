Washington was surprised by comments from Saudi King Abdullah
criticizing the US presence in Iraq and was seeking
clarification, US Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns said
Thursday.


"We were a little surprised" by the comments, Burns said, adding
"obviously, we will seek clarification" from Riyadh, which has
been a staunch US ally in the Middle East.


On Wednesday, the Saudi king criticized the "occupation" of Iraq
in an opening address to the annual Arab summit in Riyadh.


"In beloved Iraq, blood is being shed among brothers in the
shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation and ugly
sectarianism threatens civil war," Abdullah said.
