A key Taliban leader threatened on Thursday to execute an Afghan
hostage unless President Hamid Karzai entered into negotiations
for the man's release, according to a video message shown here.


Mullah Dadullah said the radical Islamist militia would kill
Afghan freelance journalist Ajmal Naqshbandi unless Karzai
started negotiating for his life and released two Taliban
prisoners.


"If Karzai is really the president of Afghanistan... he should
talk to us for Ajmal... If this doesn't happen we will kill him,"
Dadullah said in the message broadcast on the Sky TG24 channel.


Naqshbandi was captured in the southern province of Helmand on
March 4 with Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo, who was
freed around two weeks later, and an Afghan driver who was
beheaded.


Mastrogiacomo was freed in exchange for Taliban prisoners in a
deal that angered many Afghans and prompted the United States and
other countries to condemn negotiations with "terrorists."


"So far Karzai has obtained the liberation of foreigners but not
a single Afghan citizen," Dadullah said, adding that the Afghan
president was "nothing but a puppet" of Western governments.


He also lambasted Western journalists in Afghanistan for failing
to report the Taliban's side of the story. The militia was ousted
from power in Kabul by the 2001 US-led invasion but continues to
wage a guerrilla war.


The deal struck for Mastrogiacomo's release has raised concerns
that other journalists could be targeted for kidnapping, although
the Afghan government has described it as a one-off arrangement.
