The US Navy wound down air and naval exercises in the Gulf
Thursday as one of two US aircraft carriers broke off for a port
call, a navy spokesman said.


Against the backdrop of spiking tensions over Iran's seizure of
15 British marines and sailors nearly a week ago, the exercise
featured maneuvers by warships and air warfare drills.


"The major portion of the exercise, which included the dual-
carrier air operations, concluded yesterday," said Lieutenant
Commander Charles Brown, a spokesman for the US Fifth Fleet in
Bahrain.


"Today there were a few activities ongoing to wrap up the
exercise," he said.


The aircraft carrier USS John S Stennis made a port call in Gulf,
the navy said without identifying the port.


The aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower remained at sea in the Gulf.
