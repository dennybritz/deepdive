Reigning Olympic men's basketball champions Argentina will join
Brazil, Canada and Puerto Rico in an August tournament here that
will serve as a tuneup for 2008 Olympic qualifying.


Other than the US team of National Basketball Association stars
that finished third in last year's World Championships, the
August 16-18 event will feature the top Americas candidates for
berths at next year's Beijing Olympics.


The Marchand Cup, announced Thursday by FIBA Americas president
Julio Subero, will see Argentina face Brazil and the hosts
playing Canada on day one with Canada meeting Argentina and
Brazil facing Puerto Rico on the middle day.


Final games in the round robin will see Canada play Brazil and
Puerto Rico face Argentina on August 18.


The US men will have a home-court edge in the fight for two
berths to the Beijing Olympics as Las Vegas will host the 10-team
International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Americas Championship
from August 22-September 2.


While semi-final winners book a 2008 date in China, the semi-
final losers and fifth-place team still can qualify for the
Olympics through the FIBA World Olympic Qualifying tournament in
the summer of 2008.
