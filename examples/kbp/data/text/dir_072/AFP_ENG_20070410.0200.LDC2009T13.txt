Jordan's King Abdullah II said in an interview with AFP on
Tuesday that Israel must end its occupation of Arab land if it
wants to "co-exist" with the world's Muslims.


"If Israel wants to co-exist with more than a billion Muslims, it
should end its occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands," he
said.


He also urged Israel to adopt an Arab peace initiative adopted at
a summit in Saudi Arabia last month, saying it "reflects
collective Arab will to build peace that puts an end to years of
violence and suffering."


The Israeli people "should acknowledge that this is a unique
opportunity in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict and that
it is time they work to convince their leaders of the need to
resume peace negotiations in accordance with this initiative that
guarantees security and stability for all."


The five-year-old Saudi-drafted plan offers Israel normal
relations if it withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 Six
Day War, and allows for the creation of a Palestinian state and
the return of Palestinian refugees.


Israel rejected the plan when it was first adopted in 2002, but
has now said it could serve as a basis for talks provided there
were changes on the refugee issue, something the Arab leaders
rejected.
