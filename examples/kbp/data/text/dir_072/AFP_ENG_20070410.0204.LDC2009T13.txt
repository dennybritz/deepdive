A car bombing killed five people and wounded another 10 on
Tuesday near Baghdad University, Iraq's biggest and oldest
institute of higher education, security officials said.


The attack took place near the university campus in the
southwestern Jadiriyah district of the capital.


Colleges and academics have been a persistent target for
insurgents in the war- wracked country in the four years since
the US-led invasion.


A steady rattle of gunfire also reverberated across the central
Al-Fadhel district of Baghdad where security forces were raiding
insurgent hideouts.


An official with the defence ministry said one person was killed
and 15 others wounded in the raid.


US military helicopters could be seen flying over the district.
