Malaysia and the Philippines began joint naval exercises Tuesday
aimed at strengthening counter-terrorism and the fight against
smuggling, the two countries said.


Some 300 sailors, seven vessels, and aircraft from both countries
are taking part in the annual 10-day exercise along the busy
shipping corridor between the Philippine ports of Manila and
Cebu, officials of the two navies told a joint news conference.


The exercise involves both in-port training and tactical
manoeuvres at sea.


The joint exercises started in 1997, aimed at curbing piracy,
smuggling and people trafficking.
