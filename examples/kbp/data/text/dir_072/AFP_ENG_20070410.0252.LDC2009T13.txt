Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was questioned for four hours
on Tuesday as a witness in a corruption probe against a senior
aide, police said.


"The national police fraud investigations unit took testimony
from Prime Minister Olmert today for four hours in connection
with the case of the Israeli Tax Authority," police spokesman
Micky Rosenfeld told AFP.


Olmert's personal secretary and close aide of 30 years, Shula
Zaken, was placed under house arrest in February as part of the
probe into the ITA.


Its chief, Jacky Matza, has resigned in connection with the case
and at least 15 ITA employees are also under investigation.


Police began investigating the ITA in January amid allegations
that appointments, including that of Matza, were influenced by
powerful businessmen in exchange for promises of favourable tax
treatment.


Corruption probes and other scandals involving senior Israeli
officials have rocked the Jewish state over the past six months.


Among them have been several graft probes against Olmert himself,
and a looming rape indictment against president Moshe Katsav, who
has since taken a leave of absence from the largely ceremonial
post.
