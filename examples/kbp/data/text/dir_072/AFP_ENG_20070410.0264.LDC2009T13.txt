Guinea-Bissau's leader has appointed a new consensus prime
minister, bowing to pressure from the opposition which passed a
no confidence vote in the former government, state media said
Tuesday.


President Joao Bernardo Vieira named by decree Martinho Ndafa
Kabi, of the opposition African Party for the Independence of
Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, as prime minister, state radio
said.


Former prime minister Aristide Gomes last month tendered his
resignation and that of his government following the loss of a
confidence vote on March 19, amid criticism over state spending
and a failure to clear several months of pay arrears owed to
civil servants.
