A special Irish task force will examine how the country can
contribute to international efforts to reduce hunger around the
world, Aid Minister Conor Lenihan said on Tuesday.


Headed by former agriculture minister Joe Walsh, the task force
will be part of Ireland's efforts to achieve the first Millennium
Development Goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015.


"While acute hunger and famine dominate the headlines, 800
million people, including 300 million children, are persistently
malnourished due to inadequate diets.


"Underlying issues such as conflict, climate and HIV/AIDS,
contribute to this problem," Lenihan said.


"Hunger causes poverty and is a consequence of poverty.


"It is a major barrier to economic growth, with an estimated 10
percent of a country's potential gross domestic product lost as a
result of low productivity caused by hunger and malnutrition."


The 12- to 15-member body will include a mixture of national and
international experts and will be required to report before the
end of the year.
