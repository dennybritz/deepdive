Palestinian prime minister Ismail Haniya said on Tuesday that the
ball was in Israel's camp over a prisoner exchange deal for a
soldier held by Gaza militants.


"We are serious in our will to proceed with an exchange and we
hope that negotiations will lead to the freeing of our detainees
from the prisons of the Israeli occupier," Haniya told reporters
in Gaza City.


"The ball is in Israel's camp and everything now depends on the
answer that Israel will give to the just Palestinian demand to
free our prisoners," he said.


On Sunday, an Israeli official told AFP the Jewish state had
received a list of people the Palestinians want freed in exchange
for Gilad Shalit, a serviceman captured on June 25 by Gaza-based
militants, including the armed wing of Hamas.


A source close to the Palestinian government told AFP the list
contained the names of 450 prisoners.


Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is expected to convene his security
cabinet later this week to set Israel's criteria for clearing
prisoners for release.
