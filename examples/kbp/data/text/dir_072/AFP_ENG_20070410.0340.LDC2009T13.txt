Jurors began Tuesday their fourth week of considering a verdict
on an alleged British terror cell accused of plotting to blow up
targets using fertiliser bombs.


In a year-long trial at the Old Bailey court in London, the seven
men and five women on the jury sat for a 13th day since they
began deliberations on March 16.


The men -- who the court has told discussed bombing a large
London nightclub and targeting public utilities -- were arrested
on March 30, 2004 after the fertiliser was found in a west London
storage depot.


Jawad Akbar, 23, Omar Khyam, 25, his brother Shujah Mahmood, 20,
Waheed Mahmood, 35, Salahuddin Amin, 32, Anthony Garcia, 25, and
Nabeel Hussain, 21, deny conspiring to cause explosions likely to
endanger life between January 1, 2003 and March 31, 2004.


In addition, Khyam, Garcia and Hussain deny a charge under the
Terrorism Act of possessing 600 kilos (1,322 pounds) of ammonium
nitrate fertiliser for terrorism.


Khyam and Shujah Mahmood further deny possessing aluminium powder
for terrorism.


One of them discussed trying to buy a radiation "dirty bomb" from
the Russian mafia but nothing appeared to have come from his
enquiries, the trial was told.
