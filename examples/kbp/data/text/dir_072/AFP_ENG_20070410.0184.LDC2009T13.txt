Iran on Tuesday expressed reluctance to take part in an
international conference on Iraqi security if the event was to
include world powers such as its arch enemy the United States.


Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki repeated Iran's
dissatisfaction with the choice of the Egyptian resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh as the venue and said only Iraq's regional neighbours
should take part.


"We prefer a meeting of Iraq's neighbours, plus Egypt and
Bahrain," Mottaki told reporters. "We insist on a conference with
the participation of Iraq's neighbours and then we can agree
about the location."


Iraq has said the ministerial level meeting of its neighbouring
countries and world powers will be held in the Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh between May 3-4.


According to Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zabari, the meeting
will include the permanent members of the UN Security Council and
the world's eight most industrialised nations as well as Iraq's
neighbours.


The meeting is to follow-up a lower-level conference held in
Baghdad earlier this year.


Mottaki said the best decision would be for the conference to be
held in the Iraqi capital "as the message that will be sent from
Baghdad will be clearer than if the meeting takes place in New
York or somewhere else."


In any case, Mottaki ruled out any meeting with US Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice. "Under these conditions this is
excluded," he said.
