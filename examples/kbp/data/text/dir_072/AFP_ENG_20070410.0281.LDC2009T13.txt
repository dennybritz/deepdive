Two inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Iran on
Tuesday morning on a routine visit a day after President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad announced a new phase in its nuclear programme.


"Two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) arrived Tuesday morning in Tehran and are scheduled to
visit the uranium enrichment site at Natanz," the semi-official
Fars news agency reported.


The agency said it was the second visit by inspectors from the UN
nuclear watchdog this Iranian year, which started on March 21.


The deputy head of Iran's atomic energy agency, Mohammad Saeedi,
on Monday hinted that it would be up to the UN atomic agency to
reveal how many centrifuges Iran has installed to enrich uranium
at the Natanz plant.


"The number of centrifuges at the moment is clear but we do not
want to announce how many," said Saeedi.


"You can wait for the agency inspectors to report in 20 days," he
said, although it is not expected that their findings will be
immediately made public.


Ahmadinejad had on Monday said Iran's uranium enrichment
operations at Natanz were now at an "industrial scale" although
he did not give further details.
