Wall Street shares edged higher Tuesday as investors awaited a
flurry of earnings reports from corporate America in coming days
which will herald the opening of the first quarter earnings
season.


Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose a slight 3.65 points (0.03 percent) to 12,572.79 while the
Nasdaq composite gained 0.72 points (0.03 percent) to 2,469.90.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index increased a meager
0.19 points (0.01 percent) to 1,444.80.


Traders said investors might adopt a cautious approach Tuesday
with no economic news due ahead of a flurry of earnings reports
in coming days.


Banking giant Citigroup was in focus amid press reports that top
executives were set to announce thousands of job cuts Wednesday
in a bid to trim expenses.
