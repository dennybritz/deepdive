Cyprus on Tuesday launched a probe into why guests at an Orthodox
Easter celebration at an army camp complained of food poisoning
after the event attended by President Tassos Papadopoulos.


Relatives who visited their sons at Stavrovouni national guard
camp near the southern town of Larnaca claimed they suffered mild
food poisoning after the traditional Greek Orthodox festivities
where lamb is cooked over a large spit.


However, the authorities are playing down the allegations, saying
very few -- of the hundreds that attended -- visited hospital
casualty departments, while those who did showed only mild
symptoms of a stomach bug.


"There is no case of gastro-enteritis that can be associated with
eating food at Stavrovouni on Sunday," Health Minister Haris
Charalambous told state radio.


"I've given instructions to the public health service, in
cooperation with the national guard, to examine utensils used and
food left over to see if the claims stand up," he added.


The government dismissed any suggestion that the president was
feeling fine only because he received outside catering. "There
was no food ordered from outside," government spokesman
Christodoulos Pashardes said.


"The president of the republic and the other dignitaries ate the
same food as the rest of the people present," he added.
