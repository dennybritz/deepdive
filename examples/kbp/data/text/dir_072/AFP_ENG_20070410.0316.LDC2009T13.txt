Nepal's former rebel Maoists on Tuesday applied for the status of
a political party ahead of crucial elections slated for later
this year.


"We have submitted our application for recognition as a political
party at the Election Commission. Our party's official name will
be Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists)" Maoist second-in-command
Baburam Bhatterai told reporters.


The party's official symbol will be a sickle and a hammer.


The ex-insurgents joined government earlier this month -- taking
five ministerial posts in the 22-member cabinet -- after striking
a peace deal late last year.


The government is tasked with steering impoverished Nepal into
new elections which will permanently rewrite the Himalayan
nation's constitution and lead to a decision on whether to keep
the monarchy.


A date for the elections has yet to be announced, despite a June
target.


After fighting for 10 years to impose a communist republic on the
Hindu-majority kingdom in a war that left at least 13,000 people
dead, the rebels signed up for peace in November 2006.


The Maoists, who still feature on Washington's list of foreign
"terrorist" organisations, have registered their weapons and
fighters with the United Nations as part of the peace deal.
