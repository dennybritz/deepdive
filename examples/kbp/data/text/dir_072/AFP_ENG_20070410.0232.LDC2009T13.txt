Australia on Tuesday reissued its travel advice on Thailand after
a small blast in a Bangkok shopping centre, reiterating a warning
of possible bombings during an upcoming Buddhist holiday.


"Thai authorities have previously warned of the possibility of
further coordinated bombings in Thailand to coincide with
symbolic dates, including in Bangkok and the southern provinces,"
the travel advice said.


"They have mentioned the Buddhist festive season of Songkran
(around the period April 11-17, 2007) as a particular time of
concern. We assess these warnings are credible," it said.


"Further terrorist attacks could occur at any time, anywhere in
Thailand," it added.


A small bomb exploded in a telephone booth in front of the Major
Cineplex Ratchayothin shopping centre on the northern outskirts
of the city late Monday.


No one was injured, but authorities issued a nationwide security
alert and vowed to step up security during the Buddhist New Year
holiday, which begins Friday and runs for five days.


Security has already been tightened around Bangkok since
coordinated blasts on New Year's Eve killed three and wounded
more than 40.


Those attacks were followed by a coordinated arson and bombing
spree across the insurgency-hit, mainly Muslim southern provinces
at the start of the Lunar New Year in February.


The incidents left nine dead and 44 injured and were blamed on
Islamic separatists.
