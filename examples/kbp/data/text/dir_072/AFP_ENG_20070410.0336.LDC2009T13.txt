At least 34 refugees who were being smuggled from Somalia were
killed after traffickers forced them overboard off the coast of
Yemen, the UN refugee agency said Tuesday.


Witnesses and survivors said two boats that were offloading
passengers near shore last Friday, moved back out to sea after
Yemeni security forces fired at them, the office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refuigees said.


Twenty-two people from the boats drowned when they were forced
over the side, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said.


Another 12 Somalis and Ethiopians from a third boat died when
they were forced overboard far from the shoreline, he added.


Passengers said they were beaten throughout the crossing and that
at least two Ethiopian men had jumped into the shark-infested
Gulf of Aden because they were unable to endure the beatings.


A total of 635 Somalis and Ethiopians in six other boats are
believed to have reached the shore safely between Friday and
Sunday.


Some 5,600 immigrants have been landed on the Yemeni coast so far
this year, according to the UNHCR. At least 200 more have died
and many are missing.


Last year, an estimated 26,000 mainly Somalis and Ethiopians made
the perilous crossing and at least 330 are known to have died.
