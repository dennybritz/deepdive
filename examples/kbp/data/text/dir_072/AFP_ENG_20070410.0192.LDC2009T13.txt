Indian soldiers on Tuesday killed eight separatists, including
two women, during an anti-insurgency offensive in northeastern
jungles, the army said.


A two-hour gunbattle took place in Lohit district of Arunachal
Pradesh state, a thickly forested area bordering Assam, army
spokesman Colonel Narender Singh told AFP.


The dead were from the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom
(ULFA) in the group's biggest single loss in recent years.


"Our soldiers are still conducting raids and carrying out search
operations in the area looking for more ULFA hideouts," Singh
said.


Two AK-47 assault rifles and pistols were among weapons recovered
from the dead rebels.


ULFA, fighting for an independent homeland in Assam since 1979,
has been on the run since the military launched a crackdown in
January after the outfit killed 80 people, some 60 of them Hindi-
speaking migrant workers.


Intelligence reports say ULFA has shifted its base from Assam to
adjoining Arunachal Pradesh, while many rebels have fled to
neighbouring Myanmar.


After rejecting an Assam government offer of peace talks, ULFA on
Sunday triggered an explosion in Assam's main city of Guwahati,
killing one person and wounding 12 more just minutes before Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh visited the city.


ULFA says direct talks can only be held if New Delhi agrees to
discuss a  core demand of independence and releases five of their
jailed leaders.


More than 10,000 people have lost their lives to the insurgency
in Assam in the past two decades.
