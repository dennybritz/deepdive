Russian state-controlled bank Vneshtorgbank (VTB) is mulling the
sale of its 5.0 percent holding in European aerospace giant EADS,
its chief Andrei Kostin said on Tuesday.


"Perhaps we will sell them (the shares) on the market. We'll
see," he told a news conference.


"The EADS shares are also an opportunity to diversify our
portfolio. It is a justified investment," Kostin said.


"It is a commercial investment. Their price will increase, I am
convinced," he said. The potential for EADS shares is very big,
it is a very attractive investment."


The Russian state bought a 5.02 percent stake in EADS via the
bank last September, sparking fears that the oil-rich country was
seeking to exert control over the company, whose principal unit,
aircraft manufacturer Airbus, is grappling with major financial
woes.


Russian President Vladimir Putin said on an official visit to
Germany at the time that while that Moscow was interested in
cooperation with EADS, it was not planning a "hostile takeover."


At the time of the acquisition the bank had said it might
increase its shareholding.


The current distribution of power within EADS is a delicate
balance of largely German and French interests.


Airbus is currently struggling after running into production
problems with its giant A380 superjumbo project, which is about
two years behind schedule.
