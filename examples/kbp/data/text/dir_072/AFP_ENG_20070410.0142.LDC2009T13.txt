Indonesia on Tuesday welcomed the peaceful presidential election
in East Timor and repeated its vow to work with the tiny country
it occupied for more than two decades.


"As a neighbour, we welcome that the first round of the
presidential election process went well," Indonesia's Foreign
Minister Hassan Wirayuda said after Monday's vote.


"We are waiting for the results, but we will welcome whomever is
elected democratically," Wirayuda said, adding Indonesia would
seek neighbourly cooperation with East Timor.


Indonesia occupied the former Portuguese colony for 24 years
until 1999, when East Timor opted for self-determination in a UN-
administered referendum.


The period around the referendum was marred by an orgy of
violence and destruction that killed 1,400 people and was blamed
on the Indonesian military and linked militia gangs.


Monday's election was the first since East Timor, formally known
as Timor-Leste, declared independence in 2002.


Voters are seeking to replace President Xanana Gusmao, who won a
pre- independence poll but is not seeking re-election. The
charismatic former guerrilla leader spent time in an Indonesian
prison for resisting occupation.


Indonesia's invasion of East Timor led directly to the deaths of
more than 100,000 East Timorese, or 10 percent of the population,
an official investigation found.


Gusmao and Indonesia's leadership say they have moved on from
their painful past.
