Indian share prices edged higher on Tuesday to post a fifth
straight day of gains amid caution ahead of the earnings season,
dealers said.


They said investors were looking to the earnings seasons for the
January-March quarter -- which kicks off with software exporter
Infosys Technologies on Friday -- to give direction to the
market.


The benchmark 30-share Mumbai stock exchange Sensex closed up
11.8 points or 0.09 percent at 13,189.54, after gaining 321.66
points on Monday.


As of Tuesday's close, the markets have gained nearly 5.9 percent
in five days after the Sensex posted the sharpest single-day fall
this year of 616.73 points a week earlier.


"The buying spree appears to be waning. Prices eased as investors
turned cautious ahead of the earnings season. The Infosys
earnings data and guidance will set a near-term trend," said
Advait Date, dealer at brokerage BHH Securities.


Gainers led losers 1,576 to 1,004 on volume of 41.85 billion
dollars (977 million dollars).


The rupee was flat against the dollar at 42.8 while it fell
against the euro to 57.5 from 57.2.


Private sector housing finance firm HDFC rose 52.5 rupees or 3.39
percent to 1,608, while Anglo-Dutch food giant Unilever's Indian
arm, Hindustan Lever, rose 5.2 rupees or 2.8 percent to 208.8
rupees.
