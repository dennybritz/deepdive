Criminals who kidnapped two Turkish engineers in volatile
southern Nigeria have demanded ransom for their release and talks
are underway, a Turkish diplomat said Tuesday.


"The kidnappers got in touch with the men's Turkish employer and
conveyed their ransom demand," the diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity, told AFP.


"Negotiations are underway," she added, without elaborating on
the amount of the ransom demand.


The engineers, Ilker Izci and Murat Orhan, were abducted on April
6 by armed men who intercepted their vehicle while driving in
Port Harcourt.


The pair worked for Turkish telecommunications engineering
company Merpa, a subcontractor of Italian oil company Agip.


Merpa officials spoke to the pair on the telephone several times
since the abduction and found them to be in good condition, the
company said in a statement.


"They (the engineers) told us they were in good health and that
they were not subjected to maltreatment," it added.


No one has claimed responsibility for the two men's kidnapping.


Since the beginning of the year, 60 foreigners -- as many as
those kidnapped in the whole of 2006 -- have been kidnapped in
southern Nigeria.


Most of the hostages have been released unharmed, but a few have
been held for protracted periods.


Some of the hostage-takers are well-organised, well-equipped
groups fighting for a greater share of oil wealth to go to local
communities. Others are more like criminal gangs out to make
money from ransom payments.
