A Frenchman was arrested Tuesday over a series of mystery acid
attacks on women commuters who suffered serious burns after
travelling on the Paris rail network in the past month, police
said.


The 28-year-old engineer from Paris allegedly confessed to
splashing six women's clothes with an acid mix of paint stripper
and caustic soda, which he carried concealed in a cigarette pack.


Several of the victims suffered second-degree burns to their legs
and hands.


The suspect was identified from security camera footage and
detained early Tuesday in the Paris metro. He allegedly stepped
forward, telling police: "I am the one you're looking for".
