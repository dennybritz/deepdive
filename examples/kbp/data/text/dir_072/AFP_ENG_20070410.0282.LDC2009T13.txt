A 50-year-old transsexual on Tuesday became the first person in
Spain to legally change their gender without undergoing surgery
under a new law approved last month, a gay activist group said.


Julio Cuesta, who was born a woman, obtained the right to call
himself a man in official documents at a civil registry office in
Valencia, Spain's third-largest city, the director of the Lambda
gay association, Luisa Notario, told AFP.


"He has felt like a man and called himself Julio since
adolescence but he could not be operated on to change his gender
because of a handicap," she said.


The new legislation requires transsexuals to produce a medical
certificate diagnosing their gender dysfunction and show they
have undergone hormonal treatments for at least two years before
changes in identity documents can be performed.


Prior to the new law, would-be transsexuals could only change
their identity and civil status on official documents with the
approval of law courts after undergoing a sex change operation.


The Spanish endocrinological society puts the number of
transsexuals in the country at 3,000, but associations who
represent them put the figure as high as 9,000.


Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's Socialists
have already pushed through a raft of liberal social policies,
including the 2005 authorisation of same-sex "marriages" and
adoption by homosexuals.
