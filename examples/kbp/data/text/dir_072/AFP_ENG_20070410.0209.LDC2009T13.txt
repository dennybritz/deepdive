LG Philips, the world's second largest maker of flat panel
screens, said Tuesday it posted a fourth consecutive quarterly
loss in the three months to March due to weak prices.


In the first quarter, the company posted an operating loss of 208
billion won (222 million dollars) compared to a profit of 52
billion won a year ago. The results were worse than the previous
quarter's loss of 177 billion won.


Its first quarter net loss stood at 169 billion compared to the
year earlier net profit of 48 billion won and a net loss of 174
billion won the previous quarter.


Revenue totaled 2.72 trillion won in the first quarter, up 10.2
percent  year- on-year but down 11.2 percent quarter-on-quarter.


LG Philips chief financial officer Ron Wirahadiraksa predicted a
better performance in the second quarter.


"Generally, our results in the first quarter of 2007 came in
better than the guidance provided last quarter. Looking ahead, we
expect continued execution on our core operational drivers and a
healthier market situation," he said.


Liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturers are now taking a more
conservative approach to production and capital spending which
should help strengthen the market, the company said.


Last year, LG Philips suffered a net loss of 879 billion won
despite record high sales of 10.62 trillion won.


On Monday, the company said it would lay off nearly five percent
of its office workers to raise competitiveness.


Such a layoff is the first of its kind for LG Philips, which was
created in 1999 as a joint venture between South Korea's LG
Electronics and Royal Philips of the Netherlands.
