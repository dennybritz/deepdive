The presidential candidates of Nigeria's opposition parties will
meet on Thursday to forge an alliance against the ruling party in
this month's polls, officials said Tuesday.


The meeting is being convened by General Mohammadu Buhari, the
presidential flagbearer of the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP)
and it will take place in Abuja, the country's administrative
capital, they said.


But it is not yet clear if the opposition candidates will choose
a consensus candidate among themselves to challenge Umaru
Yar'Adua, the Katsina State Governor who is the candidate of the
ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) and who is favoured to win
the vote.


State governorship and state assembly polls are scheduled for
April 14 while presidential and National Assembly elections are
fixed for April 21.


The poll is expected to choose a successor to President Olusegun
Obasanjo whose second four-year term in office ends on May 29.


Obasanjo, a retired general, was elected in 1999, ending almost
16 years of military rule. He is constitutionally barred from
running for a third term.
