Jordan's King Abdullah II on Tuesday warned in an interview with
AFP that a US troop withdrawal from Iraq without a timetable
could further increase violence there.


"Withdrawal from Iraq without setting a timetable and without
preparing the necessary conditions that would ensure a strong
central government able to run the affairs of the state and an
Iraqi force able to ensure security and stability, may only
worsen the problem and contribute to increasing violence and
conflict among Iraqis," the king said.


However, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Tuesday rejected
demands by the US Congress for a timetable to pull out US troops,
saying the withdrawal should be based on the reality on the
ground.


Maliki said his government was working to improve security to
make it possible for US and other foreign troops to leave the
country, still in the grip of a deadly insurgency and sectarian
strife.


"We see no need for a withdrawal timetable because we are working
as fast as we can," Maliki told a news conference on a visit to
Tokyo.


The US Democratic Party has pushed for a withdrawal date since
seizing control of Congress from President George W. Bush's
Republicans on the back of voter anger over the Iraq war.
