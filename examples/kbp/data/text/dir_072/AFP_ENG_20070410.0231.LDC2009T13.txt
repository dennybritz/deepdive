The International Monetary Fund is set to stick to its growth
forecast of 4.9 percent for the world economy this year, sources
close to the German government said on Tuesday.


The IMF is scheduled to publish its annual spring report on
Wednesday, which contains the fund's updated forecasts for growth
in all of the world's major economies.


The IMF expected a "soft landing" for the global economy, the
sources said.


For Germany, the world's third-biggest economy, the fund was
pencilling in growth of 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent
next year, the sources continued.


And in the report, the IMF would call for additional flexibility
in the exchange rate of the Chinese yuan, they added.
