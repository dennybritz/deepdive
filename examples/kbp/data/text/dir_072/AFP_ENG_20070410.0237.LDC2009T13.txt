Freed British captive Faye Turney branded Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad "shallow" and said he looked embarrassed
after she took him to task over her detention, in comments
reported Tuesday.


Royal Navy Leading Seaman Turney, 26, recounted the moment she
came face to face with Ahmadinejad, who decided to free her and
her 14 male colleagues on April 4, 13 days after they were seized
in the northern Gulf.


According to Turney's comments to The Sun newspaper, the
detainees were taken to meet the president soon after he
announced their freedom and she was the first to be introduced,
in front of a bank of television cameras.


"How is your daughter?" he asked, speaking through a translator.


"I haven't seen her for 13 days -- remember?" Turney replied.


Ahmadinejad said: "Oh yes. But haven't you been allowed a phone
call to her?"


Turney snapped: "No, I most certainly have not."


Ahmadinejad was then momentarily lost for words before he
muttered: "Er, well, good luck in your life and your future."


Turney said Monday that while in detention she feared rape and
execution, had been stripped to her knickers, held in solitary
confinement and threatened with never seeing her three-year-old
daughter again.


"My feeling was he'd started to regret taking us, and he was
trying to say to us, 'No hard feelings, guys'," Turney said of
her encounter with Ahmadinejad.


"To me that just defined the sort of man he is -- shallow.


"It would be fair to say I'm not his biggest fan."


Her version of events would explain why Iranian television only
showed the clip of their meeting briefly and without sound, The
Sun said.
