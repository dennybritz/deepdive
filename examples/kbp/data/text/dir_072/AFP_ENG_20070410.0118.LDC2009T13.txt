Hong Kong share prices closed 0.68 percent higher Tuesday as a
fresh inflow of funds, following a five-day holiday, supported
blue chips and China stocks, dealers said.


They said sentiment was bolstered by another record finish on the
mainland's A-share markets and strong housing sales in Hong Kong
over the holiday weekend.


The market was closed from Thursday until Tuesday for the Easter
holiday and Chinese Ching Ming festival.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 138.16 points at 20,347.87, off a
low of 20,248.04 and a high of 20,416.54. Turnover was 55.50
billion Hong Kong dollars (7.1 billion US).
