Afghanistan's government said Tuesday it was doing all it could
to secure the release of two French aid workers kidnapped by
Taliban militants a week ago.


The Taliban say they have been holding a French man and woman
along with three Afghans since abducting them in the southwestern
province of Nimroz last Tuesday.


Fears mounted for the safety of the pair from the aid
organization Terre d'Enfance (A World For Our Children) after the
Taliban on Sunday beheaded an Afghan reporter they had kidnapped
a month ago.


"The security institutions are doing their utmost ... for their
safe release," President Hamid Karzai's spokesman told a weekly
news conference in Kabul when asked about the French nationals.


Spokesman Karim Rahimi refused to give details.


Karzai however said last week that no more hostage deals will be
made after a trade involving five Taliban prisoners resulted in
the freedom of Italian journalist Daniele Mastrogiacomo.


Afghan reporter Ajmal Naqshbandi, who was kidnapped with
Mastrogiacomo on March 5, was beheaded on Sunday.


The rebels have also been holding five Afghan medics since
kidnapping them in southern Kandahar province on March 27. The
rebels on Monday threatened to kill at least one of the doctors
unless the government enters talks.
