Three British people -- a couple and their 11 year-old child --
were killed in a crash on a motorway in northern France early
Tuesday, police said.


According to the initial investigation, their car was travelling
at a very slow speed and without lights when it was hit from
behind by a lorry on the A26 motorway near Laon at around 2.30 am
(0030 GMT).


Police have appealed for witnesses.
