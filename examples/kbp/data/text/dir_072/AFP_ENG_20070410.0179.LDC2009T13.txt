The world's top Internet search engine, Google, has apologised to
Chinese portal Sohu.com for using its technology in a Chinese
input product it released last week, state media said Tuesday.


Google said in a statement that Guge Pinyin, an input method
program it officially released on April 4, did include "some data
source that doesn't belong to Google in the trial period", the
China Daily reported.


Sohu.com said Sunday Google had "stolen its dictionary", saying
it not only found many similarities in the dictionaries of Guge
Pinyin and Sohu's input method product Sougou Pinyin but also the
same bugs in the two.


"We have sent Google an attorney letter and are still waiting for
their reply," Sohu.com executive Zhang Xin told AFP.


However, in its statement Google said that the product had
finished the latest upgrade Monday and the current version of the
product's dictionary was based on Google's own database.


"We will continue to intensify our research activities in our
input method product and keep consummating product functions and
users' experience," said Lee Kai-fu, president of Google China,
according to the China Daily.
