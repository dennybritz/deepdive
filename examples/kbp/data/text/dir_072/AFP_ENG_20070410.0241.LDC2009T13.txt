Five of 18 judges on Ukraine's constitutional court, which is set
to rule in a power struggle between the president and parliament,
complained Tuesday of "gross pressure" and asked for protection.


"Gross pressure has been applied," judge Volodymyr Kampo told
journalists, reading from a joint statement. "To guarantee our
security we ask to be given state protection."
