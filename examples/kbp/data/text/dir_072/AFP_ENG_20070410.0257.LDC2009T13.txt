Anglo-Swiss mining company Xstrata said Tuesday that its coal
division has agreed to purchase Gloucester Coal of Australia for
391 million Australian dollars.


Xstrata Coal's offer, equivalent to 240 million euros or 322
million dollars, has won the unanimous backing of management at
Gloucester Coal, the groups said in a joint statement.


The acquisition of Gloucester Coal, which mines coal in the
Australian state of New South Wales, was expected to complete in
mid-July and was pitched at 4.75 Australian dollars per share.


"The Gloucester Coal board of directors has advised Xstrata that
... the offer is in the interests of shareholders and unanimously
recommends that, in the absence of a superior proposal, all
shareholders vote in favour," the statement said.


Xstrata Coal chief executive Peter Coates added: "Gloucester
Coal's operations further extend the life of Xstrata's New South
Wales mines, with good potential to add to the resource and
reserve base through near-mine exploration and further resource
conversion."


The news was well received by investors in London, where Xstrata
is listed on the British capital's FTSE 100 index of leading
companies.


The group's share price, which was also buoyed by firm metals
prices, jumped 1.44 percent to 2,752 pence in early afternoon
deals. The FTSE 100 added 0.40 percent to 6,423.20 points.


A general meeting of Gloucester Coal shareholders to approve the
takeover was expected to be held in early July.
