Two US helicopters came under small arms fire in Baghdad on
Tuesday but returned safely to base, the military said.


"Two helicopters have received small arms fire. Both helicopters
returned safely to base. Both were in the central Baghdad area,"
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver in an email.


Since January 20, at least 10 US helicopters -- including two
operated by private security firms -- have come down in Iraq,
most of them to hostile fire.
