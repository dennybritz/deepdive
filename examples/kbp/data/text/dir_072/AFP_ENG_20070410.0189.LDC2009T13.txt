China's state-run broadcaster is shooting a 40-part television
series on legendary martial arts star Bruce Lee, who made a
global impact with his kung fu films, state press said Tuesday.


China Central Television is shooting "The Legend of Bruce Lee"
near his ancestral home in southern China's Shunde city, Xinhua

The 50-million-yuan (6.4-million-dollar) series stars actor Chen
Guokun as Lee and will be aired next year in time for the 2008
Beijing Olympic Games, the report said.
