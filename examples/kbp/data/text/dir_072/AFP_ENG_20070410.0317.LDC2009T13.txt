The West Indies won the toss and sent South Africa in to bat in
their Cricket World Cup Super Eight match at the Grenada National
Stadium Tuesday.


The West Indies, needing to win all three of their remaining
Super Eight matches to keep their chances of reaching the semi-
finals alive, hoped to take advantage of expected lively bowling
conditions early in the day on a new pitch.


There were three changes from the West Indian side that lost by
113 runs against Sri Lanka in Guyana in their most recent match
nine days ago.


Local favourite, Grenada batsman Devon Smith, replaced Marlon
Samuels, while Kieron Pollard and Corey Collymore came in for
Dwayne Smith and Jerome Taylor.


South Africa included batsman Herschelle Gibbs, who suffered a
calf strain during his team's shock loss against Bangladesh in
Guyana Saturday.


South Africa, who have gained one more win than the West Indies
in the Super Eight phase but also might need to win all their
last three matches, made two changes.


Batsman Loots Bosman replaced Justin Kemp, while all-rounder
Andrew Hall returned in place of Charl Langeveldt.


After early morning showers, the sun was shining brightly but
there was expected to be some dampness in the pitch to help the
seam bowlers.
