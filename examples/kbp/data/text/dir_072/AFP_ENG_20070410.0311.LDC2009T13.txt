Five bear cubs have been rescued from poachers in eastern India
as part of efforts to stamp out an illegal trade in "dancing"
bears, authorities said Tuesday.


Two poachers were arrested in Bihar state and the cubs were moved
to a zoo in the state capital Patna, police said.


"All the five cubs were in a bad shape," said forest officer
Manoj Kumar.


The poachers had recently killed the cubs' mother and were
keeping them in a house, officials said.


Poachers thread ropes through the bears' roughly-pierced snouts
and force them to stand on their hind legs as if they were
dancing. The bears are also castrated to make them less
aggressive.


Authorities said the cubs would later be transferred to the Agra
Bear Rescue Facility, a sanctuary for dancing bears run with the
assistance of Indian and international charities in northern
India.


"Now, their well-being is the main priority," said Rohit Singh of
the volunteer group Wildlife SOS.


Indian authorities are seeking to stamp out the centuries-old
practice of forcing bears to "dance."


The nomadic Kalandar tribe, who have no other source of income,
use the bears to entertain people, especially in rural areas. The
practice was banned in 1972 but has continued.


Sloth bears are traditionally preferred because the animals are
small and do not hibernate.
