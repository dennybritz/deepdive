Moroccan security forces killed one militant and another blew
himself up during a raid Tuesday in the city of Casablanca,
police said.


They said the pair died at dawn as they were being chased by
security forces in the el Fida district of Casablanca. Both were
carrying explosives, the police statement said.


"One of the two was hit by bullets and died from his injuries
while the other blew himself up just as police officers were in
the process of arresting him," the statement said.


Police had been looking for the pair in connection with an
investigation into an attack on a Casablanca Internet cafe on
March 11.


A police official said officers are searching the neighbourhood
for two other suspects who escaped following Tuesday's raid.


The Casablanca attack killed a member of a militant gang who was
carrying explosives at the time. An accomplice and three clients
in the cafe were injured.


Thirty one people have been arrested since the March 11 attack.
