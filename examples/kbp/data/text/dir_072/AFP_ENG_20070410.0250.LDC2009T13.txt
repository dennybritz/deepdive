Taiwan's leading telecom operator said Tuesday its net profit in
the three months to March rose 20.88 percent year-on-year to 12.1
billion Taiwan dollars (365.3 million US).


The value compared with 10.01 billion dollars registered in the
same period the previous year, Chunghwa Telecom said.


Sales for the three-month period rose to 45.32 billion dollars
from 44.63 billion.


Earnings per share for the period increased to 1.25 dollars from

million after it launched 3G services in late July 2005. It also
has 7.5 million 2G users.
