A communications satellite for Telesat Canada launched from a
Russian space base at Baikonur early Tuesday has gone into orbit,
the Russian Federal Space Centre said.


"The separation between the Western satellite and the Russian
Briz-M (rocket) booster happened at the scheduled time, and
control of the satellite has been turned over to the sponsor
company (Telesat Canada)," the Roskosmos space centre told
Russian news agency Ria Novosti.


A Proton rocket, Russia's most powerful launcher, lifted off at
4:54 am Tuesday (2254 GMT Monday) from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.


Roskosmos spokesman Oleg Urusov told AFP earlier that the Anik F3
satellite, a Eurostar E3000 built by EADS Astrium, was set to
separate from the rocket at 2:00 pm (0800 GMT) to achieve a
geostationary orbit at 118.7 degrees west.


The satellite, which was only expected to go online after several
weeks of tests, has been at Baikonur since the beginning of March
to undergo technical controls.


The 4.6-tonne satellite has a life expectancy of 15 years. It
will provide radio, television, Internet and other
telecommunications services in Canada and the United States.
