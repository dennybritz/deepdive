The United States has formally lodged its WTO complaint against
copyright piracy in China, marking the latest in a series of
trade spats between the two giants, a trade official said
Tuesday.


The official, who requested anonymity, confirmed that the US
trade delegation in Geneva had handed the documents detailing the
complaint to the World Trade Organisation, activating the WTO's
dispute settlement process.


The US has also filed a case accusing China of restricting
distribution of foreign music, films and books, the official
said.
