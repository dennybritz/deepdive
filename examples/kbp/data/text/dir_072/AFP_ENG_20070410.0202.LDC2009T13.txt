Republic of Ireland international defender Ian Harte will be out
for up to three weeks after an operation on his left foot, the
Spanish first division football club said here Tuesday.


Harte was operated on Monday at a local hospital to correct a
syndrome known as Morton's Foot which involved surgery on one of
his toes.


The club said that they hope he be able to start his recovery in
the gym later this week.


The only Irish player in the top flight of Spanish football also
missed the first half of the season through an ankle injury.


Harte, 29, moved to Levante in 2004 after nine years at Leeds
United but he has only featured in four league games this season,
leading to speculation in Spain and England that he may sign for
a Premiership club in the summer.
