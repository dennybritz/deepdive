French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said Tuesday that
Iran's claim to be producing enriched uranium on an industrial
scale was a "bad sign", urging it to return to negotiations.


"I deplore the announcements made yesterday (Monday), which are a
bad sign," he said in a statement. "I once again urge Iran to
respect Security Council resolutions, which demand the suspension
of all sensitive nuclear activities."


Douste-Blazy urged Tehran to "seize the opportunity to open a
dialogue (with the five Security Council members plus Germany)
that was offered to it in the statement from the six ministers at
the adoption of resolution 1747".


Iran announced this week that it is now able to enrich uranium on
an "industrial scale" and that there are plans to ramp up the
country's controversial atomic drive significantly further.


On Tuesday, diplomats based in Tehran pointed to confusion over
exactly how many uranium-enriching centrifuges it had installed.


But French foreign ministry spokesman, Jean-Baptiste Mattei, said
that "these statements are a bad sign in themselves, regardless
of the technological reality on the Iranian side."


The UN Security Council has already imposed two packages of
sanctions against Iran over its failure to heed ultimatums from
the world body to suspend uranium enrichment.


Western countries fear that Tehran is trying to develop a nuclear
weapon covertly under the guise of a civilian energy programme,
while Iran insists it simply wants to generate electricity.
