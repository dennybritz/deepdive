Two soldiers, a policeman and a militant were killed in separate
attacks by fundamentalist Taliban rebels in insurgency-hit
southern Afghanistan, officials said Tuesday.


Taliban fighters opened fire Monday on a police vehicle in the
southern city of Kandahar, sparking a gunbattle in which a
policeman and an insurgent were killed, Kandahar police chief
Esmatullah Alizai told AFP.


Kandahar was the birthplace of the hardline Islamist Taliban
regime which ruled Afghanistan from 1996-2001 and has been the
site of numerous militant attacks in recent months.


Separately on Monday Taliban rebels attacked an Afghan army
convoy near Qalat, the capital city of southern Zabul province,
on a motorway leading from Kandahar to Kabul.


In a three-hour firefight two Afghan soldiers were killed and
four were seriously injured, the army's southern commander
Rahmatullah Raofi told AFP. He had no figures for Taliban
casualties.


Since the start of the year nearly 1,000 people, most of them
militants, have been killed in violence linked to the Taliban
insurgency. Last year was the bloodiest since the Taliban were
ousted in late 2001.
