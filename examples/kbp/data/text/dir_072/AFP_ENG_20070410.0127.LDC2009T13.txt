Authorities in Macau are ready to release frozen North Korean
funds that have impeded disarmament talks, the US Treasury
Department said Tuesday.


"The United States understands that the Macau authorities are
prepared to unblock all North Korean-related accounts currently
frozen in Banco Delta Asia," the Treasury said in a statement.


"Based on previous discussions with Chinese, Macanese, and DPRK
(North Korea) officials, as well as understandings reached with
the DPRK on the use of these funds, the United States would
support a decision by the Macau authorities to unblock the
accounts in question."


Under an agreement in six-party talks, Pyongyang was to shut down
and seal its nuclear reactor and other facilities at Yongbyon by
April 14, invite in UN inspectors and receive an initial 50,000
tons of fuel oil.


But talks were stymied by a row over 25 million dollars in North
Korean funds frozen in Banco Delta Asia at US instigation on
suspicion they are linked to money-laundering and counterfeiting.
