Croatia's economy grew a better-than-expected 4.8 percent in 2006
thanks to the Balkan country's booming tourism industry,
officials said Tuesday.


The gross domestic product (GDP) result outstripped 2005's growth
rate of 4.3 percent and came in ahead of government forecasts of
4.0 percent, said the national statistics bureau.


In the last quarter of 2006, Croatia's GDP grew by 0.1 percent
from the third quarter. The largest growth for the year had been
registered in the first quarter when it stood at six percent.


The main driver of the economic growth was tourism, which
accounted for nearly 19.5 percent of GDP, driven by foreign
visitors to the country's glittering Adriatic coast.


The Croatian government expects the economy to expand by 5.0
percent in 2007.
