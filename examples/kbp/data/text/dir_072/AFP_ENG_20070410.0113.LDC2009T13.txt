World oil prices climbed slightly Tuesday after plunging a day
earlier on profit-taking.


The price of Brent North Sea crude for May delivery added 32
cents to 66.91 dollars per barrel in London electronic trading.


New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for
delivery in May, gained 20 cents to 61.71 dollars per barrel in
electronic deals before the official open of the US market.


New York crude dived 2.77 dollars and Brent shed 1.28 dollars on
Monday, as investors banked profits in light Easter trade.


Prices were coming down after last week's end to a 13-day
standoff between Britain and major oil producer Iran over 15
captured British sailors and marines.
