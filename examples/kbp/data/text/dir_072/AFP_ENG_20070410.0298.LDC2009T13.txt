Indian tourism hotspot Goa will host Britain's popular musical
and art festival, The Big Chill, on its shores this weekend,
organisers said Wednesday.


The festival will make its Indian debut on April 14 in the palm-
fringed state known for its red-carpet welcome to hippies since
the 1980s, the organisers announced in the state capital, Panaji.


"Beach parties in Goa are synonymous with (ethnic Goan) trance
music but we are offering a different kind of music and art to
the visitors here," Pete Lawrence, founder of this 1994-born
musical festival, told reporters.


Artists performing under the Big Chill Goa banner have included
dance music biggies Coldcut, The Bays and disc jockey Norman Jay,
Jose Padilla of the popular Cafe Del Mar, Tom Middleton,
Hexstatic and others.


"The Big Chill is more of a family affair. We will have different
kinds of music including Indian classical and folk music being
played during the party," Lawrence said in this former Portuguese
enclave.


Local authorities said the two-day musical carnival would be held
on scenic Ashwen beach in northern Goa.


The Big Chill, known as Britain's premier youth culture and arts
specialists, has staged festivals in such countries as Australia,
Egypt, Hungary, Japan and in the Greek Islands.


"We have grown up from a mere Sunday multi-media event (in
Britain) to a huge, popular musical event and although this
growth has been slow, it has been steady," said festival co-
founder Katrin Larkin.
