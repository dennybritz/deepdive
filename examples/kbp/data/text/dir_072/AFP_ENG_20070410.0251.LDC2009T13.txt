Moroccan security forces killed one militant and another blew
himself up during a raid on a house Tuesday in Casablanca, police
said.


They said the pair died at dawn in the el Fida district of the
city as part of a raid looking for suspects in a March 11 bomb
attack on an Internet cafe. Both were carrying explosives.


"One of the two was hit by bullets and died from his injuries
while the other blew himself up just as police officers were in
the process of arresting him," the statement said.


An officer at the scene said there were three suspects hiding in
a house that was raided.


"At around 5:00 am. one of them came into the street with a
sword. The police fired a warning shot, which he failed to obey.
They then fired a second shot before he could activate the
explosives that he was carrying," the officer said.


He said another suspect came onto the balcony after hearing the
shots. Seeing the house surrounded, he blew himself up. Police
are searching for the third suspect who fled, said the officer,
who declined to be identified.


Reports of a fourth suspect were later changed as untrue.


The March 11 attack on a Casablanca Internet cafe attack killed a
member of a militant gang who was carrying explosives at the
time. An accomplice and three clients in the cafe were injured.


Thirty one people have been arrested since the March 11 attack.
