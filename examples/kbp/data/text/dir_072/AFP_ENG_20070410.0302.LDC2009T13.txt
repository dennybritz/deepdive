Sevilla goalkeeper Andres Palop will not be fit in time to face
Tottenham Hotspur in their UEFA Cup quarter-final, second leg
match on Thursday, the Spanish club said here Tuesday.


Palop aggrevated a left calf strain during last Thursday's first
leg, which Sevilla won 2-1.


His absence will be a big blow for Sevilla coach Juande Ramos as
Palop has been one of the inspirations behind Sevilla's stunning
season and they are the only Spanish side still contesting three
titles.


In addition to still being in the UEFA Cup, Sevilla are second in
La Liga and have reached the Spanish Cup semi-finals.


Palop saved Sevilla in the last round of the UEFA Cup with a
headed goal in the dying second of normal time at Ukrainian side
Shakhtar Donetsk, which forced extra-time in which Sevilla
grabbed a winner.


He will be replaced by former Real Madrid reserve David Cobeno.


Ramos will also be without his Uruguayan backup striker Ernesto
Chevanton, who has a right thigh strain sustained in the 0-0 draw
with Racing Santander on Sunday.


However, Brazilian striker Luis Fabiano will return to the squad
after being banned for the first leg.
