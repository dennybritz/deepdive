Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev warned on Tuesday that "the
harshest possible measures" would be taken if demonstrators broke
the law at planned rallies against him this week.


"If there is even the slightest threat to the safety of
Kyrgyzstan's citizens and guests, the harshest possible measures
will be taken to end the violations and punish those who caused
them," Bakiyev said in a statement.


The growing opposition here has promised 50,000 protestors will
rally Wednesday to demand Bakiyev's resignation and a new
constitution.


Anti-presidential forces have gained strength in recent months in
this mountainous Central Asian state, which is strategically
located near Afghanistan and hosts US and Russian air bases.


Bakiyev insisted he was open to talks with the opposition, led by
his former prime minister Felix Kulov, while charging them with
planning a coup.


"A careful strategy is underway for an illegal change of power, a
government coup," he said.


Bakiyev has struggled to contain opposition in the parliament and
on the streets since he came to power in 2005 after a violent
uprising that drove out former president Aksar Akayev.


Traffic around the city's central square was blocked on Tuesday
in anticipation of the protests, while about 100 anti-Bakiyev
protestors continued a five-day hunger strike outside parliament.
