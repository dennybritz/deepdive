The presidents of eight European Union states were Tuesday set
for informal talks on the challenges facing the 27-nation bloc
half a century after its foundation stones were laid, the Latvian
president's office said.


President Vaira Vike-Freiberga has invited her counterparts from
Austria, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Portugal
for a two-day session in Riga scheduled to begin Tuesday evening.


It is the fourth such gathering of the group, which was set up in
2003 by Portugal's then head of state Jorge Sampaio to enable an
informal exchange of views among participating countries'
political leaders, policymakers and academics.


"The academic debate will be an open discussion -- an attempt to
formulate European values 50 years after the Treaty of Rome,"
organiser Zaneta Ozolina, who is head of the Latvian president's
Strategic Analysis Commission, told AFP.


"The discussions will touch upon the problem of governance in
Europe, the legitimacy of democracy, immigration and common
foreign policy," she said.
