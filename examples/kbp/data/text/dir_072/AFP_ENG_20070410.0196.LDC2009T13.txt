Shares in DaimlerChrysler soared on Tuesday after billionaire
investor Kirk Kerkorian's investment group offered 4.5 billion
dollars (3.3 billion euros) in cash to buy its struggling
Chrysler unit.


In early morning trading, shares in the German car group showed a
gain of 3.37 percent to 62.22 euros in a broadly higher market.


Kerkorian's personal holding company Tracinda Corp. said last
Thursday the offer would aim to "build and strengthen Chrysler as
an independent entity."


The casino mogul, who failed in his 1995 hostile takeover bid of
Chrysler, indicated his firm would offer an equity partnership to
the United Auto Workers and senior management of Chrysler as a
means of gaining their commitment to his long-term solution.


But Tracinda said the offer hinges on reaching a deal with
DaimlerChrysler on sharing Chrysler's massive pension and health
care liabilities and getting the UAW to agree to a "new
satisfactory collective bargaining agreement" in negotiations
this fall.


Analysts in Germany speculated on Tuesday that an even higher
offer might be on the cards.


"The market is starting to speculate on an offer higher than the
figures mentioned so far. There are rumours of an price from six
to nine billion dollars," a broker in Frankfurt said.
