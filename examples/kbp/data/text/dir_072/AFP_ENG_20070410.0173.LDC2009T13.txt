A blast has damaged a vehicle belonging to an Albanian opposition
politician who is also the editor of a newspaper, police said
Tuesday.


The explosion occurred on Monday evening in front of the building
of the largest opposition newspaper, the "Zeri I Popullit," a few
minutes after its editor, Erion Brace, parked his car there, said
police.


Brace, a Socialist Party deputy, said the attack was politically
motivated and aimed at the daily because of its negative coverage
of Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha.


Berisha recently criticised the media as being "the daggers of
the mafia" in comments that were condemned by the opposition and
non-governmental organisations.


A group critical of Berisha and the left-leaning opposition has
called on Albanians to protest Friday against what they regard as
pressure and attacks on the media.
