A Saudi man found guilty of murdering a member of his own tribe
was beheaded by the sword on Tuesday, the interior ministry
announced.


Fayiz al-Shahri was executed in the southern province of Assir
for shooting dead Hassan al-Shahri after an argument, it said in
a statement carried by the state news agency SPA.


The execution brings to 31 the number of death sentences carried
out by the Saudi authorities so far this year.


In 2006 at least 37 people were executed, while 83 were put to
death in 2005 and 35 the year before, according to AFP tallies
based on official statements.


Executions are usually carried out in public by decapitation in
ultra- conservative Saudi Arabia, which applies a strict form of
sharia, or Islamic law.


Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking can
all carry the death penalty.
