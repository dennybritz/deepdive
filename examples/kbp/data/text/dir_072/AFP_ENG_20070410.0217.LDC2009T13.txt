Serbia's war crimes court on Tuesday sentenced four former
members of a paramilitary unit to prison terms for involvement in
the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.


"The defendants are guilty ... of killing six prisoners of Muslim
origin," said judge Gordana Bozilovic Petrovic, announcing the
verdict, adding it was a war crime against a civilian population.


The fifth defendant, Aleksandar Vukov, was acquitted.
