Estonia's trade deficit soared 45 percent in 2006, increasing to
45.8 billion kroons (2.93 billion euros, 3.9 billion dollars)
from 31.6 billion kroons the previous year, the national
statistics office said Tuesday.


Imports increased by 29 percent in 2006, and exports by 24
percent, the office said.


The value of Estonia's foreign trade last year was 284.8 billion
kroons, some 27 percent higher than in 2005. Exports represented
119.5 billion kroons and imports 165.3 billion kroons.


Estonia's fellow European Union members accounted for the lion's
share of the Baltic country's trade.
