Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"It's nice to see spinners playing an important role and it's
good to see us playing two."


- New Zealand slow bowler Daniel Vettori.


"Definitely we need to play consistent as well. We don't want to
play one good game and then play three bad games. But the South
Africa win has increased confidence and morale in the team."


- Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar on his team's confidence
ahead of Wednesday's match against England.


"There's not much seam, not much swing by the time I get out
there so if I can't make runs on wickets like that, I'll never
make them."


- Australia batsman Michael Clarke who has an average of 98.66 at
the World Cup.


"Yes, we did look flat...but in the last few days the guys have
looked in the mirror and we've moved on."


- West Indies captain Brian Lara.


"If you have ten days between matches, there was nothing wrong
with going home for a short while, and it was only a few of them
who went home anyway. It wasn't a case where everybody just
walked off in frustration."


- West Indies manager Clive Lloyd supporting the decision to
grant the team a mid-tournament break.
