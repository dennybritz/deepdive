A fire swept through a Manila slum Tuesday, killing two people
and leaving at least 3,000 homeless, firefighters said, the
second blaze in two days in one of the capital's impoverished
neighbourhoods.


They said it was sparked by an oil lamp that was left unattended
in one of the houses at the Navotas fishing port on Manila Bay.


Hours after the fire, residents were sifting through the
smouldering ashes to salvage whatever they could from the ruins.


At least 400 homes made of scrap sheet iron, plywood, plastic and
cardboard were destroyed.


On Saturday, fire also razed hundreds of houses and left more
than 1,000 families homeless at a slum in Mandaluyong City in
Manila.


Fires are common in Manila's slums, where thousands of people are
crammed in filthy shacks along polluted waterways and poor areas.
