Anti-piracy dogs Lucky and Flo will remain in Malaysia for the
next few months to help authorities sniff out more counterfeit
DVD syndicates, industry officials said Tuesday.


"They will be staying in Malaysia for the foreseeable future... a
few more months. However they will be deployed outside of
Malaysia as and when there is demand," said Neil Gane, from the
Motion Picture Association (MPA).


The black labradors, which hail from Northern Ireland, are said
to be the only ones in the world trained to detect polycarbonate
and chemicals used in optical discs.


The canine pair have so far helped authorities in four successful
raids throughout the peninsula, sniffing out pirated DVDs and CDs
stored in secret compartments in stores and shopping complexes.


They were initially brought to Malaysia in February for a one-
month trial by the MPA, which investigates piracy for major
motion picture companies.


"We want to keep the dogs in Malaysia for as long as possible
after the success they have had there and we will provide
assistance to Malaysia to set up its own canine unit" if
necessary, Gane said.


Following their success, Malaysian authorities said that piracy
syndicates were trying to kill the dogs and had put a bounty on
their heads.
