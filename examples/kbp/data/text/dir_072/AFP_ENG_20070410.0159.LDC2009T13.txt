British Internet users spend an average of two days a month
surfing the web aimlessly, or "wilfing" as the activity has been
dubbed, according to a study released on Tuesday.


More than two thirds of Britons admit to wilfing -- short for
what was I looking for? -- while a quarter say they spend 30
percent or more of their time on the Internet surfing without any
purpose.


Men are bigger wilfers than women, with shopping website the
biggest distractions, according to the study by price comparison
website moneysupermarket.com.


"The Internet was designed to make it easier for people to access
the information they need quickly and conveniently," said Jason
Lloyd, head of broadband at the website.


"However, our study shows that although people log on with a
purpose, they are now being offered so much choice and online
distraction that many forget what they are there for, and spend
hours aimlessly wilfing instead."


A third of all men admitted that wilfing has harmed their
relationship -- perhaps because almost one in five confess they
are "distracted" from work or study by adult entertainment
websites.


"These days there are all manner of websites gunning for our
attention," said British television "lifestyle coach" Pete Cohen.


"Not allowing ourselves to wilf takes a mixture of planning and
willpower."


The research was compiled by the YouGov polling body based on
questioning of 2,412 adults.
