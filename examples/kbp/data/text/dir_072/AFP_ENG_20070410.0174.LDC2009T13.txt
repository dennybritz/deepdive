Everton striker James Vaughan, who severed an artery in his left
leg during his side's 1-1 draw at Bolton, was released from
hospital on Tuesday.


Vaughan, 18, was rushed to hospital after suffering the injury in
a challenge with Abdoulaye Meite midway through the second half
at the Reebok Stadium clash on Monday.


The teenager had scored Everton's equaliser in the 33rd minute
after Kevin Davies had put Bolton in front. Doctors decided to
release Vaughan from hospital after X-rays showed no bone or
ligament damage.
