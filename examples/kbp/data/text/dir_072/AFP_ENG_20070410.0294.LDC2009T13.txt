Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said on Tuesday that he would
meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert next week for the first
regular encounter agreed upon during US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice's recent visit.


"I will see Olmert next week to discuss ways of reactivating the
peace process in light of the results of the Arab summit in
Riyadh," Abbas said during a meeting with Christian leaders in
Bethlehem.


Abbas did not say which day the meeting would take place. No
confirmation could be immediately obtained from the Israeli side.


During a summit in Riyadh last month, Arab nations revived a
five-year-old peace plan that offered Israel peace and normal
ties in return for withdrawal from Arab land captured in 1967 and
the creation of a Palestinian state.


It also called for the right of return for refugees who fled or
were driven from their homes with the creation of Israel in 1948.


Israel, which rejected the peace blueprint when it was first
unveiled in 2002, has in past weeks said it could serve as a
basis for negotiations provided the refugee clause is amended,
something the Palestinians and Arab states have refused to do.


Olmert said he was ready to attend a meeting with the
Palestinians, pro-Western Arab states and international mediators
and urged Saudi Arabia to arrange such an encounter.


During her fourth visit to the region in as many months on March
27, Rice said that Olmert and Abbas would meet once every two
weeks. The two leaders have not yet met since that announcement.
