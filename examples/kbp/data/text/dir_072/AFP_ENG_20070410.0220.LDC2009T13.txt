China will remove value-added tax rebates for some steel product
exports while reducing the rebates on some others from April 15,
an industry group said Tuesday.


China will scrap export rebates for 83 types of steel products,
according to a notice issued by the finance ministry and tax
administration and posted on the website of China Iron and Steel
Association.


It will also reduce tax rebates on 76 types of speciality steel,
stainless steel products, and cold rolled steel, according to the
notice, jointly issued by Ministry of Finance and State
Administration of taxation.


The move, which has been approved by the State Council, comes
after continued overseas criticism of China's apparent inability
to rein in its large trade surplus.


China's March trade surplus plunged sharply to 6.9 billion
dollars, or 38.6 percent down from a year earlier and was less
than a third of near-record February figure, according to data
released by the customs authorities Tuesday.


But economists have said the slump was a result of exporters en
masse bringing forward March orders in order to avoid a further
reduction of value-added tax rebates threatened by officials.


China exported 14.13 million tonnes of steel products for the
first quarter, up 118.4 percent from a year earlier while billet
exports rose 98.1 percent to 1.78 million tonnes during the
period, according to data from the customs.
