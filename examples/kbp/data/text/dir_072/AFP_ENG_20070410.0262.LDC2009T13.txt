Japan will send a large delegation to Kazakhstan from April 29-30
to secure uranium and other energy supplies, a government
official said Tuesday.


The delegation would contain some 100 government officials and
corporate executives led by Minister of Economy, Trade and
Industry Akira Amari, according to the Agency for Natural
Resources and Energy official.


It would include top representatives from about 30 power
utilities, trading houses and manufacturing companies and seek to
negotiate deals in the energy sector, including Japanese
investment in Kazakh uranium mines, he said.


"The mission will not only aim to secure uranium and other fuels
but also seek wide-ranging cooperation, including Japan's
assistance to Kazakhstan's acquisition of nuclear reactors," the
official said.


In August last year, then Japanese prime minister Junichiro
Koizumi toured Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, where he offered aid
and discussed cooperation in the energy sector.


In Kazakhstan, Koizumi met with President Nursultan Nazarbayev,
who said that the emerging market of Kazakhstan and energy-
hungry, industrialised Japan "have complementary economies."


Koizumi was the first Japanese prime minister to visit Central
Asia.
