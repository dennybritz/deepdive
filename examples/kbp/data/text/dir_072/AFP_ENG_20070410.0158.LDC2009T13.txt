Hertha Berlin, who have not won any of their last eight matches,
have sacked coach Falko Gotz, the German first division club said
on Tuesday.


Berlin were on top of the Bundesliga in October but are now down
in ninth spot and, more ominously, are only five points ahead of
the relegation zone.


The 45-year-old Gotz will be replaced by second team coach
Karsten Heine who has already had two previous spells at the helm
of the club.
