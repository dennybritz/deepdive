At least 23 people died and 57 others were injured Tuesday when a
crowded bus and a truck loaded with beer collided in southern Sri
Lanka, police and doctors said.


Most of the victims were trapped and burnt to death following the
head-on crash on the main coastal road just outside a beach
resort in the town of Induruwa, 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of
Colombo.


"Fifty-seven people with injuries were brought in for treatment,"
said Jayampathy Senanayake, head of the area's main hospital. "A
few people are in a critical condition."


Most of the corpses were badly charred, and officials were trying
to identify the victims through clothing or personal effects,
hospital officials told an AFP photographer.


The bus was heading towards Colombo, police said, adding there
were no reports of any foreigners among the dead or injured.


Beer bottles in the truck exploded in the resulting inferno,
which prompted local residents to fear that a bomb had gone off.
The scene of the accident was also strewn with smashed bottles.


The accident came amid tight security at bus stations following
fears of bomb attacks by Tamil Tiger rebels. Fifteen people were
killed when a parcel bomb exploded in the same area in January.


Sri Lankan roads are some of the most dangerous in the world,
with accidents claiming at least 2,000 lives each year on a
poorly maintained network choked with more than two million
vehicles.
