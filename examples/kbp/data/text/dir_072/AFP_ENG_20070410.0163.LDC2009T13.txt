Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee left hospital Tuesday
after doctors said he was fit to return to work following a car
crash, a report said.


The 71-year-old minister suffered a head wound when a truck with
a burst tyre slammed into his bullet-proof car.


"Mukherjee was discharged from hospital this morning after a team
of specialists found him fit to resume work," a doctor at the
hospital told the Press Trust of India.


Mukherjee was travelling in convoy in the east Indian state of
West Bengal when the accident occurred, and it has raised concern
about security protection for Indian leaders. He was taken to
hospital there in a three-wheel autorickshaw before being flown
to New Delhi Sunday.


He is a veteran Congress leader who has held a host of
ministerial posts since the 1970s. Appointed defence minister in
2004, he took over foreign affairs in October last year.
