German media giant Bertelsmann is to acquire the shares it does
not already own in its US book club joint venture Bookspan, the
Wall Street Journal Europe reported on Tuesday.


Quoting sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper said that
Bertelsmann had agree to buy out Time Inc's stake in Bookspan,
which includes Book-of-the- Month Club, for 150 million euros
(112 million euros).


Time Inc is the magazine publishing unit of Time Warner.


The deal, expected to be announced later on Tuesday, would make
Bertelsmann the only major operator of book, music and DVD clubs
in the US, following the German giant's acquisition of Columbia
House music and DVD clubs in 2005, the Wall Street Journal said.
