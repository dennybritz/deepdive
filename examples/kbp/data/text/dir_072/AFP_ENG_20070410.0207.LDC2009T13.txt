German media giant Bertelsmann said Tuesday that it planned to
acquire the 50-percent it does not already own in its US book
club joint venture Bookspan in a deal that will make it one of
the biggest operators of book, music and DVD clubs in the United
States.


Bertelsmann said in a statement that it had agreed to buy out its
joint venture partner in Bookspan, Time Inc, the magazine
publishing arm of Time Warner Inc.


Financial details were not disclosed, but a report in the Wall
Street Journal Europe put the purchase price at 150 million
dollars (112 million euros).


Bookspan, set up by Time Inc and Bertelsmann in 2000, includes
Book-of-the-Month Club, the biggest book club in the US with
around eight million members.


Following Bertelsmann's acquisition of Columbia House music and
DVD clubs for 400 million dollars in 2005, the latest deal makes
the German giant one of the biggest operators of book, music and
DVD clubs in the US.
