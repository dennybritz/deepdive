Two Russian nationalists were jailed for 18 and 19 years on
Tuesday for a bomb attack which injured some 15 people on a train
linking Moscow to the Chechen capital in 2005, a report said.


Vladimir Vlassov, 48, and Mikhail Klevachev, 47, were found
guilty of terrorism, attempted murder with racial and religious
motives, and making illegal explosives, the Ria Novosti news
agency reported.


They were arrested two weeks after the June 2005 bombing of a
train travelling between Moscow and Grozny, capital of the
breakaway southern province of Chechnya where Moscow is battling
separatist Muslim rebels.


The court heard that nationalist and "extremist" literature had
been found during searches of the suspects' homes, as well as
bomb-making material.
