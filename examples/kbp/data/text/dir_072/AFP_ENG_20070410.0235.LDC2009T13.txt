An all-star lineup led by the Police, Bon Jovi and Ludacris was
named Tuesday for the New York leg of the round-the-world Live
Earth concerts to help fight global warming.


More than a dozen top musical acts, also including American Idol
champ Kelly Clarkson, the Smashing Pumpkins, Kanye West and Akon,
were announced for the July 7 show at Giants Stadium in New
Jersey outide New York City.


Others were AFI, Alicia Keys, Dave Matthews Band, Fall Out Boys,
John Mayer, KT Tunstall, Melissa Etheridge, and Roger Waters.


"We hope the energy created by Live Earth will jump start a
massive public education effort," Live Earth Co-Chair and former
US vice president Al Gore said in the statement announcing the
participants.


"Live Earth will help us reach a tipping point that's needed to
move corporations and governments to take decisive action to
solve the climate crisis."


Tickets for the show will go on sale on April 16.
