The German presidency of the EU said Tuesday Iran's claim to be
producing enriched uranium on an industrial scale was a "direct
contradiction" of two binding UN Security Council resolutions.


"Such a step would be a direct contradiction of the repeated
requests by the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of
governors and of the binding demands of the UN Security Council's
resolutions 1737 and 1747 on Iran to cease all enrichment
activities," it said.
