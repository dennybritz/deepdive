Russia sees no sign that Iran has made any breakthrough in its
nuclear fuel enrichment programme, as claimed by Tehran, the
Russian foreign ministry said Tuesday.


"We do not know of any recent technological breakthroughs in the
Iranian nuclear programme that would change the character of the
work in the field of enrichment," ministry spokesman Mikhail
Kamynin said in a statement.
