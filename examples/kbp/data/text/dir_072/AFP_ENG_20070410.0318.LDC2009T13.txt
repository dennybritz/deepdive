Spanish savings bank La Caixa and France's Suez said Tuesday they
would make a joint bid for the rest of water utility Sociedad
General de Aguas de Barcelona, or Agbar, which they do not
already own.


The two companies will offer 27 euros or 26.7 euros per share of
Agbar, depending on the type of share, in a bid which values one
of the world's biggest water firms at around four billion euros
(5.3 billion US dollars), La Caixa said in a statement.


Shares in Agbar, which has interests in Britain, Chile, Colombia,
Cuba and Mexico as well as Spain, closed at 28.03 euros on
Thursday.


La Caixa and Suez already jointly detain 47.3 percent of Agbar
through their joint investment vehicle Hisusa.


Suez owns 51 percent of Hisusa while La Caixa controls the
remaining 49 percent.


The two firms will float between 30 and 33 percent of Agbar if
their bid is successful, La Caixa said.


Agbar posted a net profit of 308 million euros on turnover of
3.12 billion euros. It employs some 27,000 people.
