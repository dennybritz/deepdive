A Saudi man lost part of his nose in a heated argument with his
two wives because he threatened to marry a third woman, Shams
newspaper reported on Tuesday.


Judaie bin Salim jokingly told his wives that he would marry
again if they were unable to resolve their differences over how
to divide their new house, the paper said.


Salim repeated the threat because of how ill-mannered his wives
had acted.


This proved a provocation too far for the women, who then
attacked him and left him with a part of his nose missing, a
broken cartilage and needing seven stitches.


"I never thought my wives would respond to such a degree," Judai
told the daily, adding the only way to restore his diginity would
be to go ahead and take a third wife.


Saudi men can be married to up to four women at a time under the
Islamic or sharia law enforced in the ultra-conservative kingdom,
so long as the wives are all treated equally.
