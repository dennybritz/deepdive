Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira on Friday said he
would not dismiss the government before he gets more details
about this week's no-confidence vote, according to a spokesman.


Three of the biggest political parties in the national assembly
on Monday called for the vote in a push for a new "government of
consensus" to encourage parliamentary stability.


Prime Minister Aristide Gomes' administration lost the vote 54 to
28, and under terms of the constitution the president was given
72 hours to dissolve the government. By Friday Vieira had not
stated his intentions.


"It is only after receiving greater clarification about some of
the deputies' demands that he will make his decision known," a
spokesman for the president's office said, without giving further
details.


Gomes was appointed prime minister in November 2005, replacing
Carlos Gomes Junior, who was sacked following a series of
disputes with Vieira.


Vieira was overthrown from power in 1999 after 19 years of iron-
fisted rule, but controversially returned from exile in Portugal
to run for the presidency as an independent in 2005.


However, since then he has had problems getting support in
parliament, in a power struggle that has weakened the
impoverished west African country.
