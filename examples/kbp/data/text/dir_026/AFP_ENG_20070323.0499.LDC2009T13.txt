Norwegian victory contender Thor Hushovd could be forced to pull
out of Milan- San Remo, the first big one-day classic of the
season this Saturday.


Hushovd's Credit Agricole team said Friday he had been suffering
the effects of an upset stomach overnight on Thursday and had so
far been unable to eat.


The Norwegian sprinter will only make a decision on Saturday
morning, although team manager Denis Roux was not optimistic:
"There's about 70 percent chance he will pull out."


Milan-San Remo is the first in a series of spring classics.


It will be followed by the Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, the
Amstel Gold Race and Liege-Bastogne-Liege.
