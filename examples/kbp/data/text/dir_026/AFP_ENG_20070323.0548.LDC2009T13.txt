Greece's university union Posdep on Friday decided to end its
strike against the government's higher education reforms
following two months of occasionally violent protests by students
and teachers.


Union president Lazaros Apekis said however that it would still
try to prevent the introduction of the government bill, which
would tighten the academic and fiscal management of public
universities.


He also said his organisation would carry out a 24-hour strike on
Wednesday to coincide with a student protest planned for the same
day.


Posdep argues the reforms would make universities undemocratic by
reducing the power of the student trade unions, and make them
elitist by introducing private- sector standards.


The conservative government notes that the bill was approved by
parliament at the beginning of March.


Friday's decision was taken as both the strike and the parallel
student demonstrations began to lose momentum. About 200 of a
total 600 university departments remain occupied, student bodies
said, down from a peak of 350.


The protests, begun in January, occasionally turned violent. In
March, 61 young people were charged after a demonstration in
Athens turned into a riot.
