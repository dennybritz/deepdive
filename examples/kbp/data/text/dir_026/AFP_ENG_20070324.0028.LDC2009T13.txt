Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi vowed Saturday his
government will not yield to terrorism after his Sunni deputy
prime minister was injured in a double bomb attack in Baghdad.


"For those terrorists, let them hear one thing. We are not going
to leave the country," Hashimi, currently visiting Tokyo, told
reporters. "We are not going to leave Iraq in these very
difficult circumstances."


"We will continue our struggle until the last minute."


Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi, a prominent Sunni Arab
leader in the Shiite-led Iraqi government, was wounded Friday
when a suicide bomber blew himself up in his residential
compound.


The attack took place when the deputy premier was praying at a
mosque inside the compound.


"Regardless of what happened, we will continue our struggle to
enhance democracy and to ensure stability in my country
regardless of the terrorist attacks," said Hashimi, a Sunni
leader himself.


The suicide bomb attack was followed minutes later by a car
bombing in the compound. The double attack killed nine people and
wounded 15 others.


Zubayi was rushed to a US military combat hospital inside the
heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad where he is undergoing
treatment.


Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's office said later Friday that
Zubayi was in a "stable" condition.
