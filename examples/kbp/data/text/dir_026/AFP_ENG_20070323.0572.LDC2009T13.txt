US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed strong concern
Friday over controversial constitutional amendments being rushed
through a popular referendum by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.


"I'm really concerned about it," Rice told reporters shortly
before leaving Washington for the southern Egyptian city of
Aswan, where she will hold talks with Mubarak.


"This is a really disappointing outcome and we will talk about it
and hopefully it will turn out better than is expected," she said
of the constitutional reforms due to go to a national referendum
on Monday.
