The US Marine Corps is investigating a marine special operations
unit in connection with an incident in Afghanistan earlier this
month in which civilians were killed, an official said Friday.


"There is an investigation being handled by the Marine Special
Operations Command -- Central Command," said the marine official,
who was not authorized to speak about the investigation.


He said it was tied to an incident on March 5 in which eight
civilians were killed and 35 wounded after a suicide bomber
ambushed a US military convoy.
