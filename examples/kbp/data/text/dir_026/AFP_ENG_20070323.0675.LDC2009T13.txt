A drought in southwestern China has left 5.5 million people short
of drinking water and resulted in millions of dollars in damages,
state press reported Saturday.


Lack of rainfall and unusually warm temperatures are to blame for
the drought that has hit farmers in Sichuan province, causing
losses of nearly 300 million yuan (38 million dollars), the
official Xinhua news agency said.


More than six million head of livestock and 560,000 hectares (1.3
million acres) of farming land had been affected, the report
said.


In the worst-hit areas, drinking water was being transported by
road to residents, it said.


Sichuan, which is one of China's key area for agricultural
production, received minimal amounts of rain in February,
draining the region's water reserves.


Reserves are down by 1.7 billion cubic metres (60 billion cubic
feet) from usual levels, the report said.
