Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko laid a draft law before
parliament on Friday which would make it illegal to deny
Ukraine's Soviet-era famine which killed up to 10 million people.


Between 1932 and 1933, millions starved as a result of a Soviet
Union programme of forced collectivisation in which Ukrainian
farmers had their produce confiscated.


The Soviet authorities also blocked food supplies into the
Ukraine in what some historians have argued was a deliberate
attempt by Stalin to crush a Ukrainian independence movement.


Historians believe that between four and ten million people died
due to the forced collectivisation programme.


Under the draft text fines of up to 340 dollars (180 euros) and
jail terms of up to two years would be imposed, according to a
statement from the president's office.


Last year, the Ukrainian parliament voted in favour of declaring
the famine an act of genocide, but stopped short of introducing a
law punishing its denial.


Yushchenko, a pro-westerner, recently promised to open a museum
dedicated to the Soviet occupation after visiting a similar one
in Tbilisi, Georgia. ant/kat/jom/awb
