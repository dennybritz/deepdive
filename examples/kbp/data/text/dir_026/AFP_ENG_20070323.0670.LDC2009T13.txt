The injury report on Angels third baseman Chone Figgins went from
bad to worse on Friday when a second broken finger was discovered
on his right hand.


A versatile player who is expected to be the Angels' starting
third baseman this season, Figgins originally was diagnosed with
a broken middle finger after suffering an injury in Wednesday's
pre-season exhibition game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.


However, X-rays taken at the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in Anaheim by
hand specialist Steve Shin on Friday revealed a fracture of the
index finger as well. The digits were placed in individual
splints, and Figgins will be re-evaluated in three weeks.


He is expected to be sidlined five to six weeks.


Figgins was fielding a ground ball off the bat of Conor Jackson
in the fifth inning when the injury occurred.


Last season, Figgins hit .267 with nine home runs, 62 RBI and 52
stolen bases.


The 29-year-old, who has played every position except first base,
catcher and pitcher in the major leagues, is a .285 career hitter
with 22 homers, 207 RBI and 163 steals in 547 games - all with
the Angels.
