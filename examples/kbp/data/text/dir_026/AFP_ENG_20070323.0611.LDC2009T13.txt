Sri Lanka seamer Chaminda Vaas believes his team are looking good
for a run to the World Cup final after virtually condemning India
to an early exit.


Sri Lanka, the 1996 world champions, made it three wins out of
three in Group B and also carry an extra two points to the next
round after beating India by 96 runs at the Queen's Park Oval.


Vaas took 2-39 after removing India openers Robin Uthappa and
Sourav Ganguly.


"The batters are hitting the ball well and all the bowlers are
doing their jobs. We are playing well with good unity," said
Vaas.


"The pitch was pretty flat today, so I tried to bowl line and
length and vary my pace. Taking early wickets for my team is
important and we hope to keep our form going through the Super
Eights."
