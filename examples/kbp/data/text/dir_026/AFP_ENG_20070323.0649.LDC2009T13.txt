US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice left Washington Friday for
the Middle East on a mission she hoped would make headway toward
resolving the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.


Rice will start her tour in Egypt, where she plans to meet the
leaders of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab
Emirates.


Before departing Friday, Rice said that she hoped the Arab League
peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians "would be offered
again and offered in a way that suggests that there might be
active follow-up to the initiative."
