At least 16 passengers have drowned in a boating accident in
Myanmar with 12 others missing, state media said Saturday.


The 40-feet (12-metre) long boat, which carried 70 passengers,
sank in a river Friday, the Myanma Ahlin newspaper said, adding
the accident occurred around 30 miles (50 kilometres) southwest
of Yangon.


The boat sank while trying to avoid a whirlpool and 42 passengers
were rescued, the daily said. The paper did not give the boat's
maximum passenger capacity.


Military-run Myanmar, one of the poorest countries in the world,
still depends on small boats as the primary means of
transportation.
