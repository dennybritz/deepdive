A Tanzanian detainee admitted that he bought explosives used in
the 1998 truck bombing of a US embassy in Dar Es Salaam but said
he did not know what they were for, according to a Defense
Department transcript released Friday.


Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani apologized at a military hearing in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for helping those who carried out the
bombing, which killed 12 people and wounded 85.


"It was without my knowledge what they were doing but I helped
them," he said. "So I apologized to the United States for what I
did."


"I'm sorry for what happened to those families who lost, who lost
their friends and their beloved ones," Ghailani to the three-
member panel, which was convened to review his status as an enemy
combatant.


Ghailani said that after the bombing he went to Afghanistan where
he was trained in explosives at an Al-Qaeda camp.


He was captured in 2004 in Pakistan, where he lived at the home
of a relative of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the
September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.


Ghailani is one of 14 top "war on terror" suspects moved to
Guantanamo in September from secret CIA detention facilities
overseas. So far, nine have gone before military panels to review
their status as enemy combatants.


The hearings are being held behind closed doors at Guantanamo,
but the Pentagon has so far released censored transcripts of five
of the hearings.
