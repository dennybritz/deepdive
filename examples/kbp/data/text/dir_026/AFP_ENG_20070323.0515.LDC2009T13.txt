A four-year-old boy was killed early on Friday after being caught
in crossfire between rival Palestinian factions in the Gaza
Strip, medical and security sources said.


In a separate incident, the body of a Fatah member kidnapped
earlier in the day along with a comrade was found in Gaza City.


Toddler Hassan Abu Nada was killed and three other people wounded
during exchanges of gunfire in the northern town of Beit Lahiya
between supporters of the Islamist Hamas and president Mahmud
Abbas's secular Fatah, the sources said.


It marked at least the third death in Gaza as a result of
internecine violence since the Palestinians formed a unity
government on Saturday, hoping to put an end to the bloodshed.


Later on Friday, two Fatah members and two Hamas members were
seized in tit-for- tat abductions that came despite an agreement
between the two groups the previous day to stop such kidnappings,
security sources said.


The new coalition government was supposed to stop factional
violence between Fatah and Hamas, which has killed dozens of
Palestinians since mid-December.


The clashes had largely ceased in Gaza since the two rivals
struck a deal to form the government in a summit in Mecca in
early February, although there have been occasional flare-ups,
sometimes as a result of family disputes.
