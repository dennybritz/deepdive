Wall Street shares closed slightly higher Friday after a better-
than-expected report on US home sales eased fears of economic
weakness ahead, offsetting the impact of a jump in oil prices.


At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up
20.75 points (0.17 percent) at 12,41.99.


The Nasdaq composite added 4.44 points (0.18 percent) to 2,456.18
while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 rose 1.70 points
(0.12 percent) to a preliminary close of 1,436.24.


Wall Street had a generally positive reaction to the latest news
on the housing front, which has been the weakest sector of the US
economy.


The National Association of Realtors reported US home sales rose
3.9 percent in February as the struggling real estate market
showed some signs of a rebound.


The annualized pace of 6.69 million was well ahead of market
expectations of a pace of 6.30 million. But median home prices
fell.


"The better-than-expected report provides some hope that a bottom
is close in the US housing correction -- at least on the sales
front," said Sal Guatieri, economist at BMO Capital Markets.


"That said, the report is just one in a sea of red housing
indicators of late, and home prices are likely to ease further as
the correction unfolds."


The positive economic news was partly offset by a jump in oil
prices to their highest level of the year. New York crude futures
rose 59 cents to close at 62.28 dollars a barrel after hitting
62.65 dollars, the highest since December 22.
