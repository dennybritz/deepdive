UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Friday called for an end to
fighting between the Democratic Republic of Congo's army and
supporters of defeated presidential candidate Jean-Pierre Bemba.


"The civilian population continues to be threatened by fighting
in the heart of the city," said Ban in a statement through his
spokesperson Marie Okabe.


Ban "urgently appeals once again for a complete halt to all
fighting," said Okabe.


The call came as soldiers restored order in Kinshasa Friday after
at least 60 people were killed in two days of fighting.


"The DRC has reached a critical turning point. The recent
violence in Kinshasa underscores the urgent need for a new
political culture in the country," the UN chief's statement said.


Ban "urges all parties to turn away from violence and to actively
pursue political dialogue at all levels," Okabe said.


Ban is currently in Egypt on the second leg of a Middle East
tour.


The DRC fighting broke out after Bemba, a former warlord, ignored
a government order for his bodyguards to be integrated into the
regular army.


It was the first such violence in Kinshasa since historic
elections five months ago.


Western security sources told AFP in Kinshasa that 49 government
troops were killed in the fighting, and quoted commanders of
Bemba's bodyguard as saying their dead, wounded, missing or
deserted approached 400, without giving any further detail.
