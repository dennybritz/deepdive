Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are to act in a movie together
for the first time since starring in box-office smash "Titanic",
BBC Films said Friday.


The pair have been cast as a young couple in "Revolutionary
Road," a tale of "thwarted passion and the search for
fulfilment," set in the 1950s.


The movie will be directed by the British actress's husband Sam
Mendes, who won a best director Oscar for his debut film
"American Beauty" (1999).


The movie, from BBC Films and DreamWorks, is based on Richard
Yates' novel and work on the project begins later this year.


"This is an extraordinary story with wide international appeal
and resonance," said David Thompson, head of BBC Films.


"Having bought the rights to the book and developed it, we could
not be more delighted at the way this film has come together."


Winslet shot to Hollywood fame when she played love-struck Rose
in "Titanic" opposite US star DiCaprio, who played drifter artist
Jack. The 1997 film won four Oscars and remains the biggest-
grossing movie ever.
