Tony Parker had 22 points and seven assists as the San Antonio
Spurs turned back a late challenge to beat the Detroit Pistons
90-89 Friday in a National Basketball Association contest.


Tim Duncan added 17 points and 14 rebounds as the Spurs swept the
two-game season series between the teams, former NBA finals foes.


The win completed San Antonio's first series sweep over Detroit
since 2002-03, when the Spurs went on to win the NBA title. When
the Spurs won the crown in 2005, they beat the Pistons in seven
games in the finals.


In the fourth quarter, Duncan and Manu Ginobili combined to score
all of San Antonio's points during an impressive 10-2 burst that
opened an 85-76 advantage with 2:20 remaining.


However, the Pistons responded with a surge of their own and cut
the deficit to 85-84 on Antonio McDyess' reverse layup with 18
seconds left.


Chauncey Billups scored six of his 13 points during the run.


Ginobili made a pair of free throws and Duncan split two to give
the Spurs an 88-84 bulge with 10 seconds to go. After Billups hit
a jumper to make it a two- point contest, Ginobili added two more
foul shots to seal the victory.


Rasheed Wallace scored 21 points and McDyess chipped in 18 off
the bench for the Pistons, whose lead over Cleveland for first
place in the Eastern Conference dwindled to 1 1/2 games.
