British police said Friday they would look at Internet footage
from a chatroom after a man apparently filmed his own suicide
while online using a webcam.


The body of Kevin Whitrick was discovered late Wednesday night
after a fellow chatroom users alerted police that the 42-year-old
had "self-harmed". Attempts to resuscitate him at the scene were
unsuccessful.


West Mercia Police in Shropshire, west central England, said
Friday a post- mortem examination had found that Whitrick died of
hanging.


Detective Chief Inspector Jon Groves said: "Our enquiries to date
have revealed that Mr Whitrick was using an Internet chatroom
with a number of other people at the time of his death.


"Police have managed to secure some of the necessary Internet
files and these will form part of our investigation.


"We are working to ensure that witness support facilities are
available to those who may have been affected by what they saw.


"We also have family liaison officers in place to support Kevin's
family at this difficult time."


Whitrick, who had 12-year-old twins, had a very serious car
accident in July 2006 and had never returned to full health,
according to his wife, who did not want to be named.
