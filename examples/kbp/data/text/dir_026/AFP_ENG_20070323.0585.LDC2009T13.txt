The White House said Friday it had no official word that Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has scrapped plans to attend
Saturday's UN Security Council meeting on Tehran's nuclear
program.


"We're not aware of any official information corroborating the
report," national security council spokeswoman Kate Starr told
AFP after an Iranian official said the trip was off.


The Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the United States was late in issuing Ahmadinejad a visa to come
to New York.
