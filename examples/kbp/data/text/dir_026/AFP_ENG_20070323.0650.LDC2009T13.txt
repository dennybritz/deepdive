Some 20 young Russians were arrested on suspicion of setting off
a bomb in a Saint-Petersburg McDonalds and racist murders and
other crimes, Russia's prosecutor general said Friday.


According to prosecutors' statement, 10 people, including five
minors, are accused of attacking foreigners, adding that most of
them regularly participated in activities of the "Movement
Against Illegal Immigration," a radical extreme- rightist group.


As part of the investigation of the bomb attack in Saint-
Petersburg's downtown McDonalds on February 18, five people were
arrested on terror charges.


Three others are suspected of racist crimes.


Prosecutors suspect some of those seized of having beaten a
Moldovan and a Cameroon native, killing one Uzbek and attempting
to murder another in February.


Racist attacks had rocketed over the past few years in Russia and
particularly Saint-Petersburg, targeting mainly natives of the
Caucasus and Central Asia as well as Asian and African
foreigners.
