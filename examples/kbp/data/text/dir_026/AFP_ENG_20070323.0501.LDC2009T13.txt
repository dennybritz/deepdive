Forty thousand customers of one of Switzerland's top supermarket
chains, Migros, are being offered tickets for an exclusive
Rolling Stones concert, provided they go on a shopping spree.


Migros, which traditionally does not sell alcohol or cigarettes,
announced Friday that it was organising the legendary rock
group's only concert in Switzerland this year during its world
tour, on August 11.


The 40,000 places in the stadium in Lausanne will be reserved for
holders of the supermarket chain's customer card who have a
minimum of 6,000 points, equivalent to 60 Swiss francs (37 euros,
49 dollars) of shopping.


Some 30,000 tickets will be distributed by lottery, while the
rest will be distributed in promotional events.


The special Rolling Stones concert is meant to mark the 10th
anniversary of Migros's customer card.
