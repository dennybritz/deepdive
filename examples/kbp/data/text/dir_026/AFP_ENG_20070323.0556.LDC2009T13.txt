Senior US Treasury official Daniel Glaser is heading back to
China to try to break a banking impasse that saw North Korea walk
out of nuclear talks this week, the Treasury said Friday.


"The policy and diplomatic issues have been solved -- this is now
down to implementation," Glaser, the deputy assistant secretary
for terrorist financing and financial crimes, said ahead of his
trip to Beijing Saturday.


Battling to unblock a financial dispute that has stalled nuclear
disarmament talks, negotiators are trying to find a bank outside
China to receive North Korean funds that lie frozen in a bank in
Macau, South Korea's envoy said.


The United States on Monday said it had cleared the way for the
release of the 25 million dollars from Banco Delta Asia (BDA) in
Macau.


But the designated recipient, the Bank of China, has refused to
accept the money for fear the transaction may hurt its credit
rating, said Chun Young-Woo, Seoul's chief nuclear negotiator.
