As many countries prepare to change the clocks Sunday, one
British newspaper cheekily suggested we should ditch the idea --
and make it GMT everywhere around the world.


Greenwich Mean Time, taking its name from Greenwich in southeast
London, is the local time in Britain during the winter and is
used across the globe as the time of reference.


At 0100 GMT Sunday, Britain switches to summer time and advances
the clocks by one hour to 02:00 am local time.


But The Daily Telegraph, a staunchly patriotic broadsheet, said
the clock- switching lark was plain irritating -- and came up
with its own cunning plan get the world's clocks ticking to a
British beat.


"The imposition is intolerable, and should be met with a more
radical proposal than the retention of nature's own Greenwich
Mean Time. We demand Global Time," the newspaper said in its
editorial.


"In other words, if it is nine o'clock here, now, it should be
nine o'clock all round the world," it insisted.


"It is no absurdity, for if we are to depart from natural time in
any case, why not choose the neat solution of making the time in
London the same as in New York?


"New Yorkers will get as used to the alarm going off at 11
o'clock as Australians have to eating Christmas dinner in high
summer. The convenience to stock exchanges and travellers is
obvious.


"As a British initiative, let it be known as Greenwich Global
Time."
