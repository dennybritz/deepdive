A statement posted in the name of a Sunni insurgent coalition led
by Al-Qaeda's Iraq branch said Saturday that it had carried out a
twin bombing which wounded Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi.


The Islamic Emirate of Iraq said its militants "succeeded with
Allah's help" in striking Zubayi, one of the leading Sunni Arabs
in the Shiite-led government.


"We pray to God not to save the life of this inferior traitor who
sold his religion and his people for a cheap return," added the
statement posted on a website used by Islamic militant groups.


The group said it would provide more details of the attack later
and warned of more strikes on "traitors" in the Iraqi government,
in an allusion to politicians from the Sunni Arab minority.


Zubayi was wounded when a suicide bomber blew himself up in his
residential compound on Friday. The attack took place when the
deputy premier was praying at a mosque inside the compound.


The suicide bombing was followed minutes later by a car bombing
in the compound. The double attack killed nine people and wounded
15.


Zubayi was rushed to a US military hospital inside the heavily
fortified Green Zone in central Baghdad where he is undergoing
treatment.
