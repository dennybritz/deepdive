US President George W. Bush on Friday vowed to veto legislation
linking funds for the Iraq war to a timeline for withdrawing US
combat troops by August 21, 2008.


Speaking after the House of Representatives now led by his
Democratic foes narrowly approved the measure, Bush denounced the
bill as "an act of political theater" and said it had "no chance
of becoming law."


"I will veto it if if comes to my desk," he promised, accusing
the Democrats of abdicating their responsibilities.
