Russia's supreme court on Friday ordered the closure of one of
the country's oldest political parties, sparking concerns that
the Kremlin is cracking down on opposition ahead of next year's
elections.


The decision came after the federal agency in charge of party
registration lodged a complaint against the Republican Party of
Russia saying its membership had dipped below 50,000.


According to Russian legislation an officially registered party
that wants the right to participate in elections must have a
membership of at least 50,000.


However, the move was greeted with suspicion.


"Without doubt, it is a political decision taken in view of the
elections," party co-president Valentina Melnikova said, adding
that the Kremlin was behind the complaint.


"These people are scared of an energetic party that has proper
independent opinions," she said.


Russia is preparing for parliamentary elections in December and a
campaign to replace President Vladimir Putin in March 2008.


Russia unveiled a bill in January to ban opposition protests
during elections.


The bill would give authorities the right to ban protests two
weeks before and two weeks after an election, and bar people
suspected of being "extremists" from taking part in them.


Communist Party deputy Ivan Melnikov was at the time quoted as
saying it showed that "the authorities are afraid of protest
action" and accused the Kremlin of being behind the measure.
