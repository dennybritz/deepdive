British Home Secretary John Reid signed the European convention
on action against human trafficking Friday, two days ahead of the
bicentenary of the abolition of slavery laws.


The agreement gives victims such as women forced into
prostitution the right to stay in Britain for at least 30 days
after escaping the grasp of traffickers.


Britain, one of the last European countries to sign the
convention, was reluctant to put its name to the convention
before now because of fears it could be abused by illegal
immigrants.


Reid signed the convention on the same table where William
Wilberforce, an English lawmaker and leader of the parliamentary
campaign against the slave trade, drew up the law on the
abolition of slavery 200 years ago.


The government also outlined a wider action plan to tackle human
trafficking which plans to introduce specialist teams at points
of entry into Britain.


Reid has described trafficking as "a stain on a civilised
country".


The Crown Prosecution Service has previously described how "slave
auctions" of women sold into prostitution take place at British
airports.


There were an estimated 4,000 victims of trafficking working in
prostitution in Britain in 2003.
