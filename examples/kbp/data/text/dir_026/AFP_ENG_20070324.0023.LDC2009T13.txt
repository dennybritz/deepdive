A Hindu judge took over as new acting chief justice of Pakistan
here Saturday in the shadow of a judicial crisis that has jolted
the country's military leader Pervez Musharraf.


Rana Bhagwandas, the senior judge of the Supreme Court, along
with four other senior judges, will deal with the fate of chief
justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, who was suspended and charged
with misconduct by the president on March 9.


National and regional bar associations boycotted Bhagwandas'
oath-taking ceremony held at the branch office in Karachi of the
Islamabad-based top court amid tight security.


The 64-year-old judge from Sindh province replaced justice Javed
Iqbal who was as acting chief judge for two weeks as Baghwandas
was on leave to India.


Lawyers have held daily countrywide protests since the suspension
of Chaudhry. Eight judges and a deputy attorney general have
already resigned in protest.


Chaudhry has denied the charges, including that he unfairly
gained promotions for his son and insisted on the use of cars and
aircraft to which he was not entitled.


Bhagwandas is expected to head a reconstituted judicial council
for further hearing of the case against Chaudhry, which is
scheduled on April 3.


The council held two sessions last week and a scheduled third
sitting was postponed, amid demonstrations by the law community
demanding reinstatement of Chaudhry.
