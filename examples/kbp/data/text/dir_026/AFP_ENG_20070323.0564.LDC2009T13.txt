Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer reported Friday that 2006
profits slid 12 percent lower in 2006, sharply hit by the
dollar's weakness.


Net profit was 390.1 million dollars, down 12.4 percent from a
year earlier when it earned 445.7 million.


In the Brazilian currency, net profit fell 12.3 percent to 621.7
million reals.


Sales were stable in dollars at 3.8 billion, but fell 8.7 percent
to 8.34 billion reals.


Chief executive Mauricio Botelho stressed Friday that there was a
"huge impact of the (US) dollar" which is weaker against the
real. It slumped from 2.43 reals in 2005 to 2.18 reals in 2006.


The company's results also took a hit in 2006 from delays in
delivering Embraer 190s and 195s due to a problem with an an
external supplier. Embraer delivered 130 planes, 15 fewer than
planned.
