Suspected separatist militants shot dead two policemen Saturday
near a busy market in Thailand's restive Muslim-majority south,
police said.


A 30-year-old corporal and a 25-year-old lance corporal, both
Buddhists, were shot in front of hundreds of shoppers who had
crowded into the weekend market in Narathiwat province.


They were killed at their outpost across the road from the market
when an unknown number of gunmen walked up and shot them at point
blank range, local police said.


More than 2,000 people have been killed in the three southern
provinces bordering Malaysia since a separatist insurgency
erupted three years ago.


The attacks have recently increased in frequency and brutality
despite a number of peace-building measures proposed by the new
government, which was installed after a coup last year.


Nine Buddhists were shot execution-style earlier this month when
militants forced their bus off the road.


A few days later, two teenage Muslim students were shot dead in
an Islamic school, prompting concern that sectarian tensions were
escalating.
