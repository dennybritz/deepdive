Former Pro Tour champion Danilo Di Luca will make his comeback
following a bout of flu at the Coppi-Bartali International five-
stage cycle race, his Liquigas team said Friday.


The 31-year-old Italian, who won the Milan-Turin race at the
beginning of the month, pulled out of last week's Tirreno-
Adriatico and Saturday's Milan-San Remo because of the virus.


The Coppi-Bartali International, which is part of the
International Cycling Union (UCI) Europe Tour, begins Tuesday and
ends Saturday.
