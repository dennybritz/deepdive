Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will not go to New York for
Saturday's UN Security Council meeting on Tehran's nuclear
programme because the United States was late in issuing him a
visa, an official source told AFP on Friday.


"President Ahmadinejad's trip has been made impossible because of
the lateness in supplying a visa by the United States," said the
source under condition of anonymity.


"Because of this, it is not possible to get the visa to Tehran on
time, and the president's trip has therefore become virtually
impossible," he added.
