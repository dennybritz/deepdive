Wales captain Ryan Giggs, who has frequently rubbished rumours
that he could one day take charge of the Wales team, suggested on
Friday he could envisage the transition to management.


The Manchester United veteran winger could eventually follow in
the footsteps of his former United team-mates Mark Hughes and
Steve Bruce, who both moved into coaching roles.


"As for management, I have friends who have gone into management
and I agree the Wales job would be a very exciting one.


"I certainly know Mark Hughes enjoyed it as Wales manager. It
came at the right time for him and was a good learning process.


"If I was to go into management then that would be the route I
would go down, definitely.


"I have seen players I never felt would be managers, Sparky
(Hughes) was one of them actually, even though you knew he had it
in him. You never thought he would take to it like he did.


"Maybe with the more vocal ones like Steve Bruce, yes, you could
see they could do it. But now Sparky has done well at club level
with a good staff around him."


On Saturday Giggs will lead Wales in the Euro 2008 qualifier at
Croke Park against the Republic of Ireland earning his 61st cap
in the process.
