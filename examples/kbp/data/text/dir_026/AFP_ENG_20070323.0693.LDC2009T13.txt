High winds forced the suspension Saturday of the women's 25km
open water world championship final as "inhuman waves" forced all
the racers out of the water at the half-way stage.


Winds reaching 40 knots whipped up the seas in Port Phillip Bay
which made it impossible to continue, organisers said.


"Al competitors have been withdrawn from the water with 12.5
kilometres of the course completed," they said, adding that world
swimming's governing body FINA would make a decision on whether
it could be restarted later in the day.


"Honestly, the first thing I thought was 'shark'," said
Australian swimmer Shelley Clark.


"You couldn't see where you were going - you were just swimming,
swimming, swimming and hoped you were going in the right
direction."


Russia's Natalya Pankina, who was second when the race was
stopped, said she had never encountered such conditions.


"The waves were unreal. I couldn't understand anything. I was
being tossed back and forth, in every direction, couldn't tell
which way, from the back, from the side," she said.


"It was the first time for me to experience such a swim. I've
never seen anything like this."


Third-placed Angela Maurer of Germany added: "These waves were
inhuman. I'm happy they called off the race. I think I never
would've finished because it was so wavy.


"I'm glad that the organisation reacted in this way because
safety is more important."
