About 40 women demonstrated in Kyrgyzstan's capital on Friday
against a proposal by Justice Minister Marat Kaiypov to
decriminalise polygamy, ahead of a parliamentary debate on
Monday.


"There remain many severe unresolved problems besides official
approval for polygamy. The abolition from the criminal code of
article 153 discriminates against the rights of Kyrgyz women,"
said activist Kalicha Umuraliyeva.


This mostly Muslim country has a secular government and under
current legislation polygamy is punishable for men by up to two
years in prison.


Another activist, Galina Kulikova, said the protesters would be
seeking Kaiypov's resignation on Monday. She pointed to the
complete absence of women from the current parliament.


"This situation just confirms the need for measures on the
presence of women in parliament," she said.


Kaiypov meanwhile told AFP that the ban on polygamy was an
inheritance from the Soviet "totalitarian past, an invented
crime."


He has argued that legalising polygamy would help with the
imbalance between the number of men and women in the country,
from which up to one million Kyrgyz, mostly men, have emigrated
to escape unemployment and poverty.
