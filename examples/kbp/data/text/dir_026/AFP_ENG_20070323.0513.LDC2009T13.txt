A British housewife married to a Mafia mobster agreed to be
extradited to Italy Friday over claims that she was a key figure
in one of the biggest crime empires in Italy.


Ann Hathaway, 44, dropped her opposition to the extradition to
Sicily because of "recent developments", her lawyer Campaspe
Lloyd-Jacob told London's City of Westminster magistrates' court,
without giving further details.


Hathaway is married to Antonio Rinzivillo -- said to be one of
the leaders of the Cosa Nostra organisation, one of Italy's
oldest Mafia groups -- who is serving a 30-year jail term for the
murder of a Milan lawyer and drug trafficking.


His wife, who the Italian authorities claim ran her husband's
crime empire when he was behind bars, will now be sent back to
Italy within 10 days.


She was arrested in Manchester, northwest England, in January and
could face up to 24 years in prison.
