A former Khmer Rouge commander, who is serving a life term for
his role in the murder of three Westerners, was sent to a
hospital Saturday for AIDS treatment, an official said.


Chhouk Rin, 54, will receive antiretroviral treatment at the
hospital in Phnom Penh, said Mong Kim Heng, the director of Prey
Sar prison in the outskirts of the Cambodian capital.


"He is still strong and healthy," he said, adding Chhouk Rin had
requested a hospital transfer.


His wife, Yem Sao, told AFP Saturday he has lost weight and is
suffering from severe headaches.


"I am very worried that he cannot live a long life," she said.


Chhouk Rin is serving a life sentence over the 1994 murder of
three Western backpackers.


The trio -- Australian David Wilson, 29, Briton Mark Slater, 28,
and Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet, 27 -- were snatched from a
train travelling between Phnom Penh and the southern coastal city
of Sihanoukville.


Thirteen Cambodians also died in the attack and the Westerners
were held for two months by Khmer Rouge rebels before ransom
negotiations failed and they were murdered.


Along with Chhouk Rin, two other former Khmer Rouge members, Nuon
Paet and Sam Bith, are serving life prison sentences for the
backpacker killings.


The Khmer Rouge terrorised Cambodia during their leader Pol Pot's
"Killing Fields" regime from 1975 to 1979, leaving up to two
million people dead due to starvation, overwork and from
execution.
