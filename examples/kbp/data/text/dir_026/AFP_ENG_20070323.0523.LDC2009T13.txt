A Ugandan court on Friday convicted a US cattle farmer on an
illegal weapons charge, but he was freed after paying a three-
dollar fine, his lawyer said.


The court convicted 26-year-old Christopher John Boehike from New
York state to either six months in jail or a fine of three
dollars after he pleaded guilty of the illegal possession of
weapons.


"He was freed after he paid the fine of 6,000 shillings (three
dollars) in accordance with the law," his lawyer David Matov told
AFP.


Boehike was arrested in November in possession of a sub-machine
gun, a pistol and rounds of ammunition and was later charged with
terrorism, but the prosecution agreed to reduce the charge to
illegal possession of firearms.


Boehike told the court that he was a volunteer who got his arms
from the United States to go to northern Uganda to hunt for its
most wanted rebel leader, Joseph Kony, sparking laughter in the
courtroom.


Ugandan authorities are wary of foreigners visiting or working in
the war-torn northern region of the country and foreign
journalists who go there are required to obtain special military
passes.


In the run-up to this year's general election, another US
citizen, a journalist and preacher, was arrested and charged with
terrorism after authorities alleged that they had found two guns
in his closet.


He was later released and deported.
