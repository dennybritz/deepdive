Iran seized a group of British sailors on Friday because they had
illegally entered its territorial waters, state television quoted
the foreign ministry as saying.


"British charge d'affaires Kate Smith was summoned to the foreign
ministry to receive a firm protest from Iran against the illegal
entry of British sailors into Iranian territorial waters," a
ministry statement said.


"This makes a number of times that British sailors have illegally
entered Iranian territorial waters at Arvand Roud. They were
arrested by border guards for investigation and questioning," the
statement added.


Arvand Roud is the Iranian name for the Shatt al-Arab waterway
that separates Iran from neighbouring Iraq.


Earlier, the British defence ministry had said 15 sailors were
seized by Iran in Iraqi territorial waters while conducting
"routine" anti-smuggling operations.
