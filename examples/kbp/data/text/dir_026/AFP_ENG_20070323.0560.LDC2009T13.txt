Two days of fighting between Democratic Republic of Congo forces
and guards loyal to opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba ended on
Friday, the United Nations mission there (MONUC) said.


In a statement, MONUC deplored the deaths of at least 60 people
in the clashes, saying it "deeply regrets the fact that force was
used in order to resolve a situation that could and should have
been settled through dialogue."


It praised the government for its part in bringing an end to the
fighting but urged it to "continue to act responsibly" in
handling the ceasefire.


In particular, it said Kinshasa would have to restore confidence
in the way it deals with the militia loyal to Bemba who have now
surrendered.


"MONUC expects that the government will act towards them in
accordance with international legal norms, as set forth in the
Geneva Conventions," it said.


The fighting, the first in Kinshasa since bloody battles
following historic elections at the end of last year, had
provoked calls from around the world for a peaceful settlement
between former vice-president Bemba and the government.


By late Friday the situation had calmed down, although there was
still sporadic gunfire in the centre and east of the city.


An arrest warrant was issued earlier in the day for Bemba for
high treason.


The former warlord and presidential candidate told Belgian public
radio VRT that was the victim of a government onslaught and
believed the authorities wanted to eliminate him.
