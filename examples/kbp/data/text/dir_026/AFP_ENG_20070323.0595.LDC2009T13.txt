India were virtually knocked out of the World Cup on Friday when
they slumped to a 69-run defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka.


The team's loss, their second in three Group B matches, means
India were left praying for a miracle to stay in the tournament,
hoping hapless Bermuda, comfortably the worst team here, can beat
Bangladesh on Sunday.


India's miserable Caribbean campaign is also a huge blow to the
image and financial credibility of the competition as Friday's
defeat comes less than a week after fellow Asian giants Pakistan
were dumped out of the World Cup after a defeat to Ireland.


India, the 1983 champions and 2003 runners-up, arrived here as
one of the favourites for the title with their much-vaunted
batting line-up widely feared and respected by rivals.


But they were outclassed by 1996 champions Sri Lanka who go into
the second round Super Eights with three wins out of three and
looking well set to make the final on April 28.


Sri Lanka made 254 for 6 off their 50 overs with opener Upal
Tharanga making 64 and Chamara Silva hitting 59.


Captain Rahul Dravid top scored for India with 60 while Virender
Sehwag made 48 with off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan finishing
with 3-41 as India were bowled out for 185.
