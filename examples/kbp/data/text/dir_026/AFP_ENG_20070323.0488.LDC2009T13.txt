Embattled cycling team Unibet will not take part in Paris-Roubaix
after organisers of the one-day classic, known as the 'Hell of
the North', anonunced their 24-team list on Friday.


Unibet have been caught in the middle of an ongoing dispute
between ASO, one of the series' major race organisers, and the
UCI, the sport's ruling body.


Also going against the Swedish-registered Belgian outfit is the
fact that advertising betting companies on French soil is against
French law.


The team, which advertises an internet betting site, had tried to
get around that second obstacle by wearing unbranded jerseys
emblazoned with a huge question mark on the front.


The team is also scheduled to wear black and orange jerseys this
weekend at the Cholet-Pays De Loire race. Those will be
amblazoned with the Canyon.com name of their bike supplier.


ASO, the organiser of Paris-Roubaix as well as the Tour de France
and numerous other events, have issued six invitations to non-Pro
Tour teams including Astana, Wiesenhof, Chocolade Jacques,
Landbouwkrediet, Agritubel and Skil.


Swiss racer Fabian Cancellara, of the CSC team, is the reigning
champion in the race which meanders over the tight and often
cobbled back roads from Compiegne, to the north of Paris, to the
finish at the Roubaix velodrome.
