The State Department on Friday denied the existence of a US
document reportedly guaranteeing safety for indicted Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic in exchange for his withdrawal from
public life.


The Montenegrin daily Republika reported Thursday that Karadzic,
wanted by UN war crimes tribunal since 1995, agreed to withdraw
from public life in exchange for the assurance.


The Republika also published what they said was a copy of the
June 1996 agreement apparently bearing the signatures of Karadzic
and Richard Holbrooke, the former US envoy to the Balkans.


The document is "absolutely false," said State Department
spokesman Sean McCormack on Friday.


"The US does not and will not stand aside and allow war criminals
to escape the hands of justice," he said.


"We continue to call for (Karadzic) being handed over to The
Hague so that he faces justice for the crimes that he has
committed."


Holbrooke chief of staff Ashley Bommer on Thursdy dismissed the
alleged document as "a crude and obvious forgery."


In 2004, Karadzic's wife, Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic, said that such
a document existed.


Karadzic and his former military chief Ratko Mladic have been at
large since they were indicted by the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.


They face charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and
genocide, mainly in relation to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of
8,000 Muslim men and boys, the single worst atrocity in Europe
since World War II.
