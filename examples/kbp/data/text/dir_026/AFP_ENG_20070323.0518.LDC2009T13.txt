Despairing trade negotiators on Friday called on the wizardry of
Harry Potter to prise open global agricultural markets, amid
ongoing deadlock in their talks at the World Trade Organisation,
an official said.


Crawford Falconer, who is heading tense negotiations between the
150 WTO members on the vexed issue of farm trade, admitted after
a meeting here that there was still no progress despite more than
five years of negotiations.


"Apart from some people appealing for help from Harry Potter, I
had no new ideas in that room," the New Zealander commented
wryly.


Falconer said the long-running attempt to bridge the gap between
rich and poor countries, and net farm exporters and importers,
appeared on the brink of running out of steam.


"The danger is energy just running out," he told journalists at
WTO headqaurters.


"That's not there yet but I can see that kind of sceptical
resignation in a lot of eyes at the moment," he added.


Falconer is aiming to draw up a stock-taking report on the state
of the negotiations by the middle of April. He said the
subsequent period would be "critical" for the trade negotiations.


The WTO is hoping to conjure up a compromise formula in the trade
round before the end of June, when crucial trade negotiating
powers for US President George Bush are due to expire.
