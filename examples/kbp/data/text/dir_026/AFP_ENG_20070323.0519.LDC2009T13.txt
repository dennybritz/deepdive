The world's largest civilian aircraft, the Airbus A380
superjumbo, took off here Friday on a test flight to Hong Kong
after being delayed for more than three hours by technical
problems.


A spare part to rectify a fault in the plane's hydraulic system
had to be flown by private jet to Frankfurt airport from Airbus
headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse.


The plane, carrying 439 passengers, had been expected to take off
at 1430 GMT but eventually lifted off at 1743 GMT.


Two of the double-decker craft landed on US soil for the first
time on Monday, greeted by large crowds as they touched down in
Los Angeles and New York.


The plane now heading to Hong Kong flew to John F. Kennedy
airport in New York and later made a stop on Chicago before
returning to Frankfurt on Thursday morning.


The A380 made its maiden flight to Asia last year, visiting seven
cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. The first A380 for
commercial use is scheduled to be delivered to Singapore Airlines
in October.
