Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zubayi was still a patient
in a US military hospital in Baghdad after being wounded in a
double bomb attack, US military spokesman told AFP Saturday.


"He is still in the hospital," Lieutenant Colonel Christopher
Garver said without providing other details.


Zubayi, a prominent Sunni Arab leader in the Shiite-led Iraqi
government, was wounded when a suicide bomber blew himself up in
his residential compound.


The attack took place when the deputy premier was praying at a
mosque inside the compound.


The suicide bomb attack was followed minutes later by a car
bombing in the compound. The double attack killed nine people and
wounded 15 others.


Zubayi was rushed to a US military combat hospital inside the
heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad where he is undergoing
treatment.
