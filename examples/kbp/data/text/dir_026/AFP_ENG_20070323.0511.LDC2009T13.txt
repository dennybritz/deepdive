The capture of 15 British navy personnel carrying out anti-
smuggling checks in the Gulf echoes an incident in 2004 when
eight troops were detained for three days and paraded on Iranian
television.


The six marines and two Royal Navy sailors were training Iraqis
to patrol the country's rivers and inland waterways in June that
year when they were detained on the Shatt al-Arab waterway.


This route, which divides southern Iraq and Iran, is also where
the latest arrests were made.


Britain's then defence secretary Geoff Hoon insisted that the men
had been "forcibly escorted" over the maritime border by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards.


But according to Iran, the boats, which have still not been
returned to Britain, were intercepted only after they entered
Iranian waters.


Although the servicemen were not harmed during their detention,
Britain was angered by their forced appearance on Iranian
television wearing blindfolds.


And while Iranian officials have not yet responded to the
situation due to New Year celebrations, it is likely that the
diplomatic spat which accompanied the 2004 incident will be
repeated this time around.


British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett has already summoned
Iran's ambassador to London to give an explanation of what
happened, saying: "We are leaving them in no doubt that we want
the immediate and safe return of our personnel and their
equipment."
