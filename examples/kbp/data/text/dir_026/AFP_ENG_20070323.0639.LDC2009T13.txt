The UN Security Council will vote on a resolution expanding
sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program Saturday at 1900 GMT,
sponsors of the measure said Friday.


Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, France's ambassador to the United
Nations, said minor changes to the resolution were made Friday
and still had to be referred back to the governments of the 15
council members, but he was confident it would be adopted
unanimously.
