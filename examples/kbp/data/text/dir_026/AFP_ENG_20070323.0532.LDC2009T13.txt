Former Beatle Sir McCartney insisted Friday his friendship with
an ex-girlfriend of Britain's Prince Charles is purely platonic,
as he battles through a messy divorce.


"There is no relationship beyond friendship," said his spokesman
Stuart Bell, after newspaper reports linking him with Sabrina
Guinness, a 52-year-old socialite who went out with Charles
before his 1981 marriage to Diana.


"I realise everyone wants to see me with a new bird right now and
that's very flattering," McCartney told the Daily Mail.


"I have known this lady for a while. We enjoy each other's
company. When we get together, we talk about stuff like the
environment and (green crusader and former US vice president) Al
Gore, things like that.


"I have had a terrible day at the office and as you probably
know, I'm going through a pretty difficult divorce right now
too."


McCartney, 64, and 39-year-old former model Heather Mills are
currently locked in a High Court divorce battle which is also
being played out across the pages of Britain's tabloids.


The couple have a three-year-old daughter, Beatrice.
