Belgian second seed Justine Henin advanced to the third round
while Australian Lleyton Hewitt withdrew because of a back injury
here Friday at an 6.9 million- dollar WTA and ATP Masters Series
event.


Henin eliminated American Vania King 6-4, 6-1 to book a third-
round date with France's Virginie Razzano, who eliminated
Germany's Martina Muller 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) in another second-round
encounter.


Hewitt's departure eases the path for Scottish teen Andy Murray,
the 12th seed who could have faced the Aussie in the third round.


The British star still has Chilean fifth seed Fernando Gonzalez
and US third seed Andy Roddick in his quarter of the draw.


Hewitt was replaced by US lucky loser Robert Kendrick, who was
set to face Dutchman Raemon Sluiter in a second-round match later
Friday.


Also reaching the third round on the women's side was China's Li
Na, who ousted Austrian Tamira Paszek 6-2, 6-0. She will next
face the winner between Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik and
Russia's Alina Jidkova.
