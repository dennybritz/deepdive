Kobe Bryant became just the second player in National Basketball
Association history to score 50 or more points in four straight
games with a 50-point outburst on Friday.


The red-hot superstar led the Los Angeles Lakers to a 111-105
victory over the New Orleans Hornets, making 16-of-29 shots from
the field and all 16f his free- throw attempts.


He joined NBA legend Wilt Chamberlain as the only player to score
at least 50 points in four or more consecutive games. Chamberlain
accomplished the feat in five consecutive games in 1962.


Bryant scored 65 points a week ago against Portland and followed
it up with a 50-point effort against Minnesota the following. He
poured in 60 against Memphis on Thursday.


New Orleans held a 59-56 lead early in the third quarter before
the Lakers went on a 25-6 run over six minutes capped off by
Bryant's 3-pointer, which made the score 81-65 with 4:54
remaining in the period.


Bryant scored 15 points during the run.


The Hornets pulled back within 92-86 on Jannero Pargo's 3-pointer
with 7:07 remaining in the game, but Bryant held them off with
six points down the stretch.


Lamar Odom added 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the
Lakers, who moved two games ahead of Denver for the sixth seed in
the Western Conference playoffs.


Chris Paul scored 28 points and Tyson Chandler made some history
of his own, scoring 22 points and grabbing 22 rebounds to become
the first Hornets player to go for 20 and 20 since Anthony Mason
10 seasons ago.
