Indonesia has kept its border with East Timor shut despite Dili's
requests to open the crucial supply link, an official said
Saturday.


"Indonesia denied East Timor's requests to open land borders that
have been closed since February 26," local Indonesian governor
Piet Alexander Tallo told reporters here.


Indonesia shut border crossings last month following a request
from East Timorese Prime Minister Jose Ramos-Horta to prevent
armed militias led by rebel leader Alfredo Reinhado infiltrating
into Indonesia.


However, the move had a major impact in East Timorese supplies
that are mostly imported through the border with Indonesia.


The East Timorese consul in Kupang, Caetano de Sousa Gutteres,
said late Friday that his country had submitted an official
request for the border to be opened on March 1.


"We asked Indonesia to open the border so supplies, about 90
percent of which come in through land crossings, into East Timor
(can return to normal)," he said.


East Timor started campaigns for a April 9 presidential election
on Friday. Ramos-Horta, the prime minister and Nobel laureate, is
seen as favourite to win.


Candidates have signed a code of conduct designed to ensure the
election is fair and peaceful, amid fears of unrest related to
Reinado, who is being hunted by the international security force
and is said to have some popular support.
