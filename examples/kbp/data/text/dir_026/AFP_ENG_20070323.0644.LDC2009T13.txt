The UN Security Council will vote on a resolution expanding
sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program at 1900 GMT Saturday,
sponsors of the measure said Friday.


Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, France's ambassador to the United
Nations, said minor changes to the resolution were made Friday
and still had to be referred back to the governments of the 15
council members, but he was confident it would be adopted
unanimously.


The resolution would deepen earlier sanctions leveled in December
by banning Tehran from exporting arms, calling for voluntary
trade sanctions and expanding a list of officials and companies
targeted for financial and travel restrictions.


The permanent five members of the Security Council -- China,
United States, France, Britain and Russia -- together with non-
member Germany have pushed the sanctions because Iran refuses to
bow to demands to halt the enrichment of uranium, which world
powers believe is aimed at producing a nuclear weapon.
