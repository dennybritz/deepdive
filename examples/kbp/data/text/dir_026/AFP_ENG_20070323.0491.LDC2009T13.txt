A test flight to Hong Kong of the world's largest civilian
aircraft, the Airbus A380 superjumbo, was delayed by technical
problems here on Friday, Airbus said.


A spare part to rectify a fault in the plane's hydraulic system
had to be flown by private jet to Frankfurt airport from Airbus
headquarters in the southern French city of Toulouse.


The plane, carrying 439 passengers, had been expected to take off
at 1430 GMT but was still on the runway two and a half hours
later.


Two of the double-decker craft landed on US soil for the first
time on Monday, greeted by large crowds as they touched down in
Los Angeles and New York.


The plane that will now head to Hong Kong flew to John F. Kennedy
airport in New York and later made a stop on Chicago before
returning to Frankfurt on Thursday morning.


The A380 made its maiden flight to Asia last year, visiting seven
cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. The first A380 for
commercial use is scheduled to be delivered to Singapore Airlines
in October.
