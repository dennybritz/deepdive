All 11 people on board a cargo plane shot down over Mogadishu on
Friday killed, a Red Cross-Red Crescent official said.


"All the 11 are dead. Ten died on the spot and one died in
hospital," the official, who asked not to be named, told AFP on
Saturday.


The Belarussian plane was hit by a rocket shortly after takeoff
from Mogadishu airport and crashed in the capital's northern
Karan neigbourhood, according to Somali government spokesman
Hussein Mohamed Muhamoud.


The Red Cross-Red Crescent, which operates at the hospital where
the victims of the crash had been brought, did not specify their
nationalities.


Airport officials said the plane had brought engineers and
equipment to Mogadishu to repair another, an Ilyushin-76
chartered by the African Union, which was hit by a rocket and
seriously damaged when landing two weeks ago.


Friday's rocket attack came as fighting erupted for a third
straight day in Mogadishu, breaking a ceasefire agreement between
Somalia's powerful Hawiye clan and the Ethiopian army made only
hours earlier.


At least 24 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded
this week in the heaviest fighting since the government and its
Ethiopian allies drove out rival Islamists from the capital three
months ago.
