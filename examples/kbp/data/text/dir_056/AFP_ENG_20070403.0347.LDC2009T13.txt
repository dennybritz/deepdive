The bosses of French first division rivals Lyon and St. Etienne
were on Tuesday banned from all official functions by the French
football federation (FFF) for inflammatory comments made before
last month's league derby.


St. Etienne president Bernard Caiazzo was banned for three months
of which a month has been suspended, and Lyon counterpart Jean-
Michel Aulas, for a month of which two weeks were suspended.


The national ethics council of the FFF said the sanctions, taken
as a result of statements made during the March 3 tie which Lyon
won 3-1, would take effect from April 9.


The local derby at St Etienne's Geoffroy Guichard stadium was
held up for 20 minutes after smoke bombs were thrown onto the
field of play and police responded by firing tear gas into the
crowd.
