England Under-21 winger Gabriel Agbonlahor on Tuesday signed a
new four-year contract with Aston Villa which will keep him at
Premiership club until the summer of 2011.


The 20-year-old still had just over two years to run on his
current deal which he signed last summer.


"Gabby has been superb for us this season," said Villa manager
Martin O'Neill of the youngster who scored in Villa's 1-1 draw
with Everton on Monday.


"Like with any young player he has had the occasional up and
down, but overall he has been excellent and the new contract is
for a couple more years on top of what he already had left."


O'Neill is also hoping to tie up the future of defender Olof
Mellberg and midfielder Gavin McCann in the next two weeks.


McCann's 10th booking of the campaign against Everton means he
will miss next Monday's home game with Wigan and the trip to
Middlesbrough on April 14.
