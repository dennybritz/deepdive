An Australian firm, Albidon Limited, launched the construction of
a 100 million dollar new nickel mine in southern Zambia on
Tuesday, a project which will lead to dozens of people being
displaced.


The Munali Nickel Project is estimated to have an output of over
900,000 tonnes of nickel, which is expected to be mined for a
period of 10 years, company chief executive officer Dale Rodgers
announced.


"The company will invest more than 100 million dollars in the
project," Rodgers said at the launch attended by Zambia President
Levy Mwanawasa.


Albidon said it would construct houses for the over 50 villagers
expected to be displaced by the construction of the new mine
situated in Mazabuka, a tiny town 60 kilometres south of the
capital, Lusaka.


The mine is due to begin production next year, according to the
owners.


However, the construction of the mine has raised concern among
civil society groups who are opposed to the displacement of
villagers from their traditional land.


Mwanawasa has commended Albidon for investing in the project
which will create jobs in the drought-prone area.
