Toyota Motor Sales hit a new US sales record in March, boosted by
strong demand for gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, the Japanese
automaker said Tuesday.

quarterly sales rose 8.3 percent to 605,855 vehicles.


"This month marks a milestone eight years in the making," said

"Record US sales of Toyota and Lexus hybrids have now topped the
half-million mark."


Hybrid sales in March rose 105 percent to 28,453 vehicles while
year-to-date hybrid sales rose 68 percent to 61,635 vehicles.


Sales of Toyota's popular Prius hybrid hit an all-time monthly
high of 19,156 vehicles sold, an increase of 133.2 percent from
March of last year.


Total passenger car sales rose 15.1 percent to 140,009, led by
strong sales of the new Camry. Truck sales rose 7.7 percent to
242,675 vehicles in March.
