Google's search engine proved unable to help the company this
week when a staffer's pet python went missing in the Internet
giant's massive New York offices.


The one-meter (three-foot) snake, named Kaiser, went missing over
the weekend, in what many thought at first to be an April Fool's
Day prank.


After more than a day sliding around the company's palatial
offices, which are big enough to house four soccer pitches,
Kaiser finally turned up late Monday night, a company spokeswoman
said, without revealing further details.


"We are pleased to report that Kaiser was located in the office
last night," Google's communications director, Ellen West, said
in a statement.


Kaiser had since left the building -- with his owner, she added.
