Hong Kong's government approved Tuesday the building of a
controversial liquefied natural gas storage plant on a remote
island, a plan environmental activists say will spell disaster
for groups of rare pink dolphins that live in nearby seas.


The Environmental Protection Department issued a statement saying
it had given the go-ahead to energy company China Light and Power
(CLP) to build the plant on the uninhabited South Soko Island.


Environmentalists have objected to the plan, saying disturbance
during its construction would damage the shoreline habitats of
local marine species, including pods of the Chinese pink dolphin.


Numbers of the dolphins have declined significantly in recent
years due to increased human activity on the waters of the Pearl
River Estuary, where they once thrived, and due to pollution.
