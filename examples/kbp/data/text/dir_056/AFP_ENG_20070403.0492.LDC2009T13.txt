Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in Syria Tuesday
to join President Bashar al-Assad in watching a friendly match
between top football clubs from the two countries.


Erdogan, who played football in amateur Istanbul clubs in his
youth, is a  fan of Turkish league leaders Fenerbahce, who are
taking on Syrian first-division outfit Al-Ittihad in the game
which marks the opening of their new stadium in the northern city
of Aleppo.


Erdogan was to hold talks with the Syrian president on the
"situation in the region" on the sidelines of the game, the
official SANA news agency reported.


Damascus had long strained relations with Ankara over its
harbouring of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, but in 1998
he was forced to leave Syria and was eventually captured, tried
and imprisoned by the Turkish authorities.
