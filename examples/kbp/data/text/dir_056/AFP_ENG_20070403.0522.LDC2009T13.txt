Rwandan genocide survivors and rights groups criticised European
Union countries Tuesday for giving safe haven to suspects in the
1994 massacres.


"Thirteen years after the Rwandan genocide, it is unacceptable
that perpetrators continue to live freely in Europe," the
International Federation for Human Rights and the Redress Trust
anti-torture group said.


They said that of 93 suspects living abroad, 37 were thought to
be living in European countries including Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and non-EU
member Norway.


"Governments have an obligation to investigate these allegations
and where sufficient evidence exists, to bring these persons to
justice," they said at a meeting in Brussels with survivors
groups and lawyers.


Some 800,000 people, most of them ethnic Tutsis, were killed
within six weeks in Rwanda in 1994 by members of the Hutu ethnic
group.


The genocide followed years of tension between the two groups and
was sparked by the death of president Juvenal Habyarimana, a
Hutu, in a plane crash.


The non-governmental organisations urged the EU to fully
investigate genocide suspects on their territories, prosecute
individuals where there is credible evidence and boost
cooperation on detecting suspects.


They also urged tougher screening of visa applicants to ensure
they have not been involved in serious international crimes.
