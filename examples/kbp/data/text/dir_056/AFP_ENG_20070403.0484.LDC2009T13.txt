The Roman Catholic bishop of Britain's armed forces issued a plea
Tuesday from "one religious leader to another" calling on Iran's
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to help free 15 naval
personnel.


"Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, in the name of his
nation and in the name of Islam, has the unique opportunity to
gain the world's respect for its Islamic laws and values," Bishop
Tom Burns said in a statement.


"As one religious leader to another, I therefore ask him to show
generosity by allowing one navy to return the sailors and marines
of another to their mother ship."


Burns said that this would "break the impasse" and allow Britain
to make clear that "every care will be taken to avoid a similar
situation in the future."


He praised the sailors and marines for trying to act with
"dignity and integrity," adding: "They are obviously trying to do
their best to defuse a difficult situation."


Burns also praised Iran for apparently treating the group well,
saying: "This approach is also in accordance with both the
Islamic and the Christian faith."


Pictures of the group relaxing have been released, while Iran
claims that all 15 sailors have confessed to intruding into
Iranian waters.


Britain however insists that the group remained in Iraqi
territorial waters.
