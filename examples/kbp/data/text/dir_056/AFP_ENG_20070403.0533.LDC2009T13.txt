Four Bangladeshi workers who had been culling chickens infected
with bird flu were admitted to hospital in Kuwait with flu-like
symptoms Tuesday, the health ministry said.


"The four men are members of the teams combating the disease and
have been involved in culling chickens. They were admitted to
hospital over suspicions they might be infected," ministry
spokesman Ahmad al-Shatti told AFP.


Shatti said it was not the first time that anyone had been
admitted to hospital to be kept under observation for the
disease.


A total of 22 people have so far been admitted to the infectious
diseases hospital for monitoring before being discharged after
testing negative.


The spokesman said there was greater concern for the four new
admissions, however, as they had been handling infected fowl.


Kuwait has culled some 1.7 million birds, most of them layer-
chickens in four commercial poultry farms, since confirming an
outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus that is
dangerous to humans on February 25.


A total of 106 cases of the strain have so far been confirmed in
birds.
