US President George W. Bush on Tuesday praised Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe's "candor" over so-called "comfort women"
used as sex slaves during World War II, the White House said.


In a telephone conversation, the two leaders also discussed
efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear programs as well as
quell deadly violence in Iraq, national security spokesman Gordon
Johndroe said in a statement.


Bush told Abe, who recently apologized on the issue of so-called
"comfort women," that "he appreciated his candor and noted that
Japan today is not the Japan of World War II," said Johndroe.


"President Bush said that he has confidence in the compassion of
the Japanese people," the spokesman added.


Bush and Aber also discussed the six-nation talks on North
Korea's nuclear weapons programs "and the need to hold North
Korea to the timetable in the February 13th agreement" in which
Pyongyang accepted restrictions in return for economic aid and
political benefits, said Johndroe.


"The president thanked the prime minister for the continued
commitment of the Japanese Self Defense Forces to Iraq," he said.
