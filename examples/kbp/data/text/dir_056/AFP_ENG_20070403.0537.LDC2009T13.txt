Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards admitted to snorting his
own father's ashes in an interview publicised Tuesday.


"The strangest thing I've tried to snort? My father, I snorted my
father," he told the New Musical Express (NME).


"He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a
little bit of blow (cocaine). My dad wouldn't have cared, he
didn't give a shit.


"It went down pretty well and I'm still alive."


Richards, whose father Bert died in 2002 at the age of 84, has
been notorious for his drug use since the Stones became worldwide
stars in the 1960s.


But he also directed an angry tirade at fellow drug-user Pete
Doherty, the frontman of British band Babyshambles currently
dating supermodel Kate Moss, who he predicted could be killed by
his love of narcotics.


"My advice for Pete Doherty is that he should shut the fuck up
and leave her," he said.


"I don't know the man, all I know is he's pushing his luck and
there it is, but so is Kate, who I know very well.


"Kate wants to play with bad boys and she's done one, and then
another one, and then another one. Badabing, badabing, badaboom.
She'll live, the boys will die."


As well as co-writing hits such as "Brown Sugar", "Street
Fighting Man" and "Miss You", Richards has become known in recent
years as the inspiration for Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow
in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" films.
