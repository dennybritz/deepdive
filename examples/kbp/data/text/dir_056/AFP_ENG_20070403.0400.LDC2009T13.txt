Atletico Madrid's Portuguese international midfielder Maniche
finally underwent hernia surgery but should be back training in
less than a week, the Spanish club said here Tuesday.


The club did not comment on when Maniche would actually be
available for selection by club coach Javier Aguirre.


The injury forced the 29-year-old to miss Atletico's last two
Spanish league matches against Real Zaragoza and Real Mallorca.


Maniche, who signed for Atletico Madrid from Dynamo Moscow last
summer, has scored three times in the league this season.


Atletico Madrid are in sixth place in the Spanish first division
with 44 points, 12 behind leaders Barcelona, but still on the
verge of qualifying for Europe for the first time since 2000.
