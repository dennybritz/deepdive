African leaders gathered in the Senegal capital on Tuesday for
the swearing in of President Abdoulaye Wade following his re-
election to a new five-year term.


Around 20 African heads of state and 60,000 Senegalese are
expected to pack out the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium for the
ceremony.


Wade, a lawyer who spent a quarter of a century in opposition
before coming to power in 2000, saw off 14 other candidates to
win a second term on February 25 with 56 percent of the vote.


The country's highest electoral court dismissed allegations of
irregularities from two other candidates.


International monitors noted irregularities but said they were
not serious enough to affect the outcome and declared the
election free and transparent in the only country in West Africa
never to have experienced a coup d'etat.


None of the other candidates scored more than 15 percent of the
vote and the opposition is now threatening to boycott
parliamentary elections on June 3.
