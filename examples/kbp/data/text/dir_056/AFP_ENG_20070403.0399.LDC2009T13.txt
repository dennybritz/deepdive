Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told US President George W.
Bush on Tuesday that he stands by Tokyo's apology to World War II
sex slaves amid a row over his remarks, a report said.


The conservative premier caused an uproar last month when he
denied Japanese troops directly coerced so-called "comfort women"
into army brothels.


Abe has since said he stands by Japan's landmark 1993 apology to
comfort women that acknowledged wartime authorities were involved
"directly or indirectly" in their plight.


In a telephone conversation, Abe explained to Bush his position
and is believed to have restated his commitment to the 1993
statement, Kyodo News said, quoting an unnamed source.


No immediate confirmation was available late Tuesday in Tokyo.


Japan has been lobbying hard against a bill being considered by
the US Congress that would demand Tokyo issue a fresh,
unambiguous apology to comfort women and make amends.


The bill quietly died in the legislature in recent years but is
seen as more likely to be passed since the Democrats took control
from Bush's Republicans in January.


Abe, who took office in September with a mission to build a more
assertive Japan proud of its past, is due to pay his first visit
to Washington as premier later this month or in early May.


Abe's predecessor Junichiro Koizumi was one of Bush's closest
overseas allies.


Historians say up to 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea but
also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan, were
forced to serve as sex slaves in Japanese army brothels.
