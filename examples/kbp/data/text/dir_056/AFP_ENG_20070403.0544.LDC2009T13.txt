Cuba and Spain are to re-establish economic cooperation broken
off in 2002 during a diplomatic crisis between Havana and the
European Union, the Spanish foreign minister said here Tuesday.


Spain's Miguel Angel Moratinos, in Cuba on a two-day visit that
began Monday, is the first European Union foreign minister to
visit Cuba since the EU imposed sanctions in 2003.


"We are going to sign a document in which Spanish cooperation
once again will be present in Cuba," said Moratinos, speaking
after a meeting with Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage.


Moratinos also met with Cuban interim president Raul Castro, who
took over in July after his brother Fidel underwent
gastrointestinal surgery. On Monday he held talks with Cuban
counterpart Felipe Perez Roque.


The EU imposed political and diplomatic sanctions on Cuba in 2003
after the regime arrested and sentenced 75 dissidents to terms of
six to 28 years of prison. Sixteen have since been released due
to poor health.


The sanctions were suspended in 2005 at the urging of Spain's
Socialist government. The EU must decide in June whether to
extend the sanctions.


Spain's policy on Cuba has shifted since Socialist Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero came to power in 2004. His
conservative predecessor, Jose Maria Aznar, had adopted a policy
of isolating the Communist island.
