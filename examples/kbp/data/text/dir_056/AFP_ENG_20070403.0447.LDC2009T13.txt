BMW Oracle on Tuesday won the first regatta of Act 13 of the
Louis Vuitton Cup yachting race.


The US challenger finished 3min 34sec ahead of South African Team
Shosholoza with Italy's Mascalzone Latino third at 4:18.


America's Cup holders Alinghi of Switzerland finished fourth at
5min 04sec with the second regatta which had been scheduled to
take place later Tuesday postponed because of irregular wind
conditions.


"The day's second regatta will not take place because of bad
weather conditions," organisers said.


Act 13 is the final preliminary heat for sport's oldest prize
held here this week.


This week's heat will see the 11 boats hoping to win the right to
take on Alinghi in the head-to-head for yachting's most
prestigious prize before the start of the competition proper.


That comes on April 16 with the Louis-Vuitton Cup which will
determine which boat goes through to the 32nd America's Cup match
race against Alinghi which begins on June 23.
