US House speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived in the Syrian capital
Tuesday for a two- day visit that has drawn White House protests
that she is undermining US policy.


Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem received Pelosi, an ardent
opponent of US President George W. Bush, who is also expected to
hold talks with President Bashar al-Assad.


Pelosi has said her talks with Assad are key to renewing dialogue
with Syria on the troubled Iraq and Lebanon issues.
