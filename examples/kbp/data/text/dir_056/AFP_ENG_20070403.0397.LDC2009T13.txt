Ukraine's pro-Russian governing coalition has officially asked
the constitutional court to rule on the legality of President
Viktor Yushchenko's order to dissolve parliament, the court told
AFP Tuesday.


"If the court decides the text is urgent, it should, according to
the law, give its verdict within one month," spokesman Ivan
Avramov said.
