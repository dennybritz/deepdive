National Grid said on Tuesday it has agreed to sell its UK
Wireless business to Australian bank Macquarie for 2.5 billion
pounds (3.7 billion euros, 4.9 billion dollars) in cash.


National Grid, known for its operations of electricity and gas
networks across Britain, said in a statement that it expected the
deal to "enhance earnings per share immediately."


As a result of the deal, it would return 1.8 billion pounds to
shareholders via an extension of the existing share buy-back
programme.


"National Grid is pleased to announce that it has signed and
expects to complete today an agreement with Macquarie UK
Broadcast Ventures Limited, parent company of Arqiva Limited, on
the sale of its UK Wireless business for a total cash
consideration of 2.5 billion pounds," the statement said.


National Grid describes National Grid Wireless as the leading
independent provider of network infrastructure to mobile network
operators in Britain.


National Grid Wireless operates around 5,000 active sites used
for mobile communications. It is also one of two providers of
transmission networks for analogue and digital television and
radio broadcasters with around 750 purpose- built broadcast
towers and associated transmission equipment.


For the year ended March 31, 2006, National Grid Wireless UK
generated operating profit of 70 million pounds on revenues of
297 million pounds.
