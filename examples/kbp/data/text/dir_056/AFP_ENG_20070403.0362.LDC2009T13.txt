Packets of blood found in the offices of Spanish doctor Eufemiano
Fuentes, who is alleged to have masterminded doping programmes
for top athletes, have been confirmed as coming from former
German cycling star Jan Ullrich.


A court in Bonn obtained a saliva sample from Ullrich last July
after he was implicated in the Fuentes affair to compare his DNA
with blood packets found with the codes "Jan" or "N.1".


Prosecutor Friedrich Apostel revealed Tuesday that there was "no
doubt" that the blood was indeed that of Ullrich, a former winner
and five-time runner-up of the Tour de France, who announced his
retirement from cycling in February.


Ullrich was one of dozens of cyclists implicated in the alleged
doping network in Spain, which forced him out of competing in
last year's Tour de France along with many other top cyclists.


The 33-year-old, Germany's only winner of the world's most
prestigious bike race in 1997 claimed he never once cheated in
his career.


After being implicated in the scandal, dubbed 'Operation Puerto',
Ullrich was eventually sacked by his T-Mobile team during the
race.


The team said at the time that damaging evidence from Spanish
investigators in Madrid prompted the decision to drop their star
rider.
