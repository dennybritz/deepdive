England's front row injury crisis got worse on Tuesday after it
was revealed that loose-head prop Tim Payne would miss the summer
tour of South Africa and the European Cup semi-final for his club
Wasps.


The 27-year-old - who played in the last two Six Nations matches
- damaged knee ligaments in Wasps' stunning 35-13 thrashing of
Irish province Leinster in last Saturday's European Cup quarter-
final and will see a specialist next week.


Payne's absence would be a real blow as the player widely
regarded as the best in the position Sale's injury-prone Andrew
Sheridan is a doubt for the South Africa tour because of a knee
injury.


"We are all very sorry to be losing Tim for the last part of the
season," said Wasps director of rugby Ian McGeechan.


"He has been one of our most consistent players this year, and
his good form was rewarded with selection to start for England at
the end of the Six Nations."


Payne got his international chance when Perpignan's Perry
Freshwater was dropped following the record 43-13 thrashing by
Ireland - Sheridan had sat out the tournament because of injury.


He had only just returned to action when he suffered another
injury on March 24.
