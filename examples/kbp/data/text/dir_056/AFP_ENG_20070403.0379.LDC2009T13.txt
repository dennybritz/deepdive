President George W. Bush on Tuesday said there should be no "quid
pro quos" with Iran in Britain's standoff with Iran over 15
captive sailors.


Asked if five Iranians held in Iraq should be released to favor a
possible release of the Britons, Bush said "I also strongly
support the prime minister's (Tony Blair's) declaration that
there should be no quid pro quos when it comes to the hostages."
