Tens of thousands of bird lovers are homing in on a nest on top
of a chimney in western Poland thanks to a webcam giving an
online glimpse of the trials and tribulations of two pairs of
storks.


"Last year, we had 1.4 million visitors to our website. Right
now, we're getting 20,000 to 30,000 hits a day," said Hubert
Kalinski, the brains behind www.bociany.kalinski.pl.


"Two couples are battling it out to occupy the nest this year.
The first of them arrived at the end of March," Kalinski told
AFP.


The nest sits on top of the chimney of a house in Chyby, a small
village near Poznan in western Poland.


Last year it was home to "Zabcia" and her partner "Klekotek", who
became the proud parents of two chicks.


Neither of the feuding couples has produced any offspring so far
this year, but alert Internet ornithologists are looking out for
the moment when one of the females lays her eggs.


Poland is the temporary home of a massive population of migrating
white storks, playing host during the spring and summer months to
40,000 of the world's estimated 160,000 breeding pairs.
