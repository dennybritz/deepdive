Wall Street saw a strong opening Tuesday after crude oil prices
dipped on signals that tensions appeared to ease between Iran and
Britain over the Islamic republic's holding of 15 British
sailors.


The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 50.06 points (0.40
percent) to 12,432.36 and the Nasdaq composite increased 10.78
points (0.45 percent) to 2,433.04 in opening trades.


The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index advanced 5.01
points (0.35 percent) to 1,429.56.


With no major economic news on tap, Wall Street eyed oil prices,
which fell after Iran and Britain started talks described as a
first step towards resolving the row over the capture.


New York crude futures fell 87 cents to 65.07 dollars a barrel.


For the stock market, "a drop in oil prices seems to be the focal
point," said Dick Green at Briefing.com.


This decline came "on the growing belief that the standoff
between Iran and the UK regarding the capture of 15 British
sailors will be resolved without military conflict," he added.
