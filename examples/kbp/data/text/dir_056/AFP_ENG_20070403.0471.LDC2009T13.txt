China Tuesday banned journalists and newspapers from extorting
money in return for stories, state media said, three months after
the fatal beating of a journalist who had tried to blackmail a
mine owner.


"Local newspaper branches and their staff reporters are not
allowed to engage in any extortion by threatening to expose
inside stories," said a circular issued by the General
Administration of Press and Publication, according to the Xinhua
news agency.


In January, Lan Chengzhang, a Shanxi employee of the Beijing-
based China Trade News died in hospital from head injuries after
he was attacked by a gang of eight hired by the boss of an
unlicenced coal mine.


An inquiry confirmed that Lan, who did not have a national press
card and was not an experienced reporter, was trying to extort
money from the owner, according to the report.


Six people have been charged over the beating to death of Lan, in
a case that sparked nationwide outrage, an official said Tuesday.
