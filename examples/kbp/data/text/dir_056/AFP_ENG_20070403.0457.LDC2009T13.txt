US President George W. Bush Tuesday said the policy that bans
gays from serving openly in the US military was "good policy,"
but declined to take a moral stand on homosexuality.


Asked about recent comments from the military's top officier that
homosexuality was "immoral," Bush said, "I will not be rendering
judgment about individual orientation."


But, he added, "I do believe the 'don't ask/don't tell' policy is
good policy."


In March, Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
told the Chicago Tribune that he thought homosexual acts were
immoral, sparking an outcry from gay rights groups and a rebuke
from the Bush administration.


"I believe homosexual acts between two individuals are immoral
and that we should not condone immoral acts," he said.


"I do not believe the United States is well served by a policy
that says it is OK to be immoral in any way."


Pace was defending the duty to apply the 1993 "don't ask, don't
tell" law that allows gays to serve only if they do not declare
their sexual orientation or engage in homosexual conduct.


At the time, Joe Solomonese, president of Human Rights Campaign,
said Pace's comments "were irresponsible, offensive and a slap in
the face to the gay men and women who are currently serving their
country with honor and bravery."


The comments also drew measured criticism from the Defense
Secretary Robert Gates, who said Pace's "personal opinion doesn't
really have a place here."


The controversial policy has been in place since 1993 and,
according to a 2005 report, has forced some 10,000 soliders from
the ranks despite the struggle to meet recruiting goals.
