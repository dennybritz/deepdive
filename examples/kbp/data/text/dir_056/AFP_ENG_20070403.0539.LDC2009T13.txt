French energy group Total denied on Tuesday that it had been
summoned by the US Securities Exchange and the US Department of
Justice to explain the group's activities in Iran.


Citing two separate sources, the online edition of French
newspaper La Tribune claimed Tuesday that Total had received a
summons on March 29.


Total chief executive Christophe de Margerie has already been
targeted in a French corruption probe into a major gas deal
signed by Total in Iran in 1997.


"Neither Total nor any of its executives have been summoned by
the SEC or the Department of Justice," a spokeswoman told AFP.


In Washington, the Department of Justice declined to comment on
the press report.


The Total spokeswoman said that the company had stated in its
2004 annual report that the SEC was investigating the activities
of energy companies in Iran, including those of Total.
