Play resumed after a 48-minute rain interruption in the World Cup
Super Eights match between South Africa and Ireland at the Guyana
National Stadium here on Tuesday.


Rain forced the players to return to the pavilion with Ireland,
put in to bat, 17-1 in the tenth over. The match had started 15
minutes late after overnight and early morning rain left the
field wet.


The match was reduced to 47-overs-a-side.


More showers were forecast later in the day.
