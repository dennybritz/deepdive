South Africa coach Mickey Arthur believes his team's elevation to
the world number one ranking is reward for hard work as well as a
desire to throw off the country's traditional caution.


In 18 months the Proteas, one of the favourites for the ongoing
World Cup, have moved from fifth place in the rankings to top
spot where they deposed world champions Australia.


"When I came in I came with a plan," said Arthur.


"To get from five in the world to one, we have worked very hard
at that. We have worked on players' roles and who fits into what
positions. After 18 months, it's quite nice to be number one."


Arthur believes that the work with captain Graeme Smith has also
led to a new mindset in the South Africa team which has seen a
more positive approach to the one-day game.


That could be crucual for a side who have known only heartbreak
and misery when it has come to the World Cup.


"We are a more positive side, our fielding has reached a new
level," said Arthur.


"There has been a change in the mindset. We attack more in the
middle overs. Our attack is an attack, not a defence, and it's
looking to strike with the new ball.


"We have slips and gully in for longer periods of time. It's all
a testament to all the hard work the players have put in over the
last 18 months."
