New York authorities are fuming after the developers of video
game Grand Theft Auto, in which players rob and kill their way to
the next level, set the latest version of the game in the city.


While the previous version of the game, Grand Theft Auto III, was
set in a fictional Liberty City, loosely based on New York, the
fourth version openly features landmarks such as the Statue of
Liberty and the Empire State Building.


Other editions of the game have been loosely set in San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and London.


"The mayor does not support any video game where you earn points
for injuring or killing police officers," Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's office said in a statement, pointing out that car
theft during his tenure had in fact fallen.


Grand Theft Auto IV is due to be released in October.
