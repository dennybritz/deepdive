South Africa captain Graeme Smith won the toss and elected to
bowl first in the World Cup Super Eights match against Ireland at
the Guyana National Stadium here on Tuesday:


South Africa brought back batsman Ashwell Prince in place of
spinner Robin Peterson from their line-up which beat Sri Lanka by
one wicket in their first Super Eights match last week.


Ireland, who lost their first Super Eights match to England,
brought in Paul Mooney for Kevin O'Brien.


Overnight rain and wet outfield delayed the start by 15 minutes.
