Ireland were 19-1 after 10 overs of their rain-interrupted World
Cup Super Eights match against South Africa at the Guyana
National Stadium here on Tuesday.


Eoin Morgan was on 13 with William Porterfield on four.


Opener Jeremy Bray fell lbw to Shaun Pollock for nought in the
third over.


South Africa brought back batsman Ashwell Prince in place of
spinner Robin Peterson from their line-up which beat Sri Lanka by
one wicket in their first Super Eights match last week.


Ireland, who lost their first Super Eights match to England,
brought in Paul Mooney for Kevin O'Brien.
