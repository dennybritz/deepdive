The Italian government on Tuesday passed new laws they hope will
stamp out football hooliganism.


Strict new security measures were introduced shortly after a
policeman was killed when Catania fans went on the rampage
before, during and after their derby match against Sicilian
rivals Palermo in February.


The government clampdown demanded clubs took more responsibilty
for security, including more closed-circuit television (CCTV)
cameras at stadiums, named tickets, electronic turnstiles,
adequate stewarding, and crowd filtering areas outside grounds.


These measures, known as a 'Decreto' were only temporary and had
to be approved in parliament within 50 days for them to become
law.


On Tuesday the law was approved with a unanimous vote.


In addition the government agreed that children under the age of
14 who are accompanied by an adult should be allowed into
stadiums for free, while any fan in possession of a banner that
incites violence or contains offensive language faces arrest.
