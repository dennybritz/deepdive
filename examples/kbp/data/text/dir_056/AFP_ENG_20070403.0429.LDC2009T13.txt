Rain stopped action for a second time in the World Cup Super
Eights match between South Africa and Ireland at Guyana National
Stadium here on Tuesday.


Play had resumed after a 48-minute delay but as Ireland
progressed from 17-1 to 20-1 in 11 overs, heavy rain forced the
players back to pavilion again.


The match was reduced to 47-over-a-side.


Earlier, overnight and early morning rain had delayed the start
by 15 minutes.
