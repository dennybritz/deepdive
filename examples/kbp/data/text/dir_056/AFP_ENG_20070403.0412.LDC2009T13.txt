British aerospace giant Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday it had signed
a deal to supply its Trent jet engine to aircraft leasing company
CIT Aerospace, potentially worth up to 560 million dollars (418
million euros) at list prices.


CIT Aerospace, a unit of US-based CIT Group, is purchasing the
Trent 700 for an order of Airbus A330s and the Trent 1000 for an
order for Boeing 787s.


To date CIT Aerospace has taken delivery of eight A330s powered
by the Trent 700.
