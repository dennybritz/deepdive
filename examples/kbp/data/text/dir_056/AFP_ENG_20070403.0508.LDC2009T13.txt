The Football Association (FA) on Tuesday cleared Tottenham of any
blame after a fan ran on to the pitch following their FA Cup
replay and aimed a punch at Chelsea's Frank Lampard.


Chelsea's 2-1 quarter-final win at White Hart Lane was
overshadowed by an incident after the final whistle when Timothy
Smith, 18, ran on to the pitch and swung at Lampard, with the
England midfielder ducking out of the way.


It led to the FA looking at the security provisions at Spurs and,
after club officials also submitted a safety report, the club
will not face punishment.


"After reviewing a video of the incident and receiving a full
report from Spurs, there will not be any disciplinary action
against the club," said an FA spokesman.


The fan has since been banned from attending football matches in
England and Wales for three years, while Spurs have barred him
from the club for life.


Another fan who ran on to the pitch also received a three-year
ban and both offenders were fined 300 pounds.
