More than 110 people have been killed in floods and avalanches
across Afghanistan over the past four days, the interior ministry
said Tuesday.


Floods caused by nearly a week of heavy rain killed 91 people,
the ministry said in a statement that gave the first national
toll for the bad weather brought on by melting winter snows and
heavy spring rains.


Avalanches in the central province of Bamiyan and the
northeastern province of Badakshan killed another 23, it said.


Badakshan was struck by an 6.2-magnitude earthquake Tuesday but
there were no reports of casualties.


The interior ministry said thousands of livestock were killed and
large swathes of farmland were also destroyed in the past four
days. Nineteen of the country's 34 provinces had been affected,
it said.


The United Nations said up to 25,000 people had been affected by
floods and avalanches.
