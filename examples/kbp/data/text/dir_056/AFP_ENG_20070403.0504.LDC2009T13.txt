A Yemeni court jailed a Saudi for four years Tuesday for
fraudulently obtaining Yemeni papers to travel to Iraq to join
the anti-US insurgency.


A second Saudi who remains on the run was also given a four-year
sentence after being tried in absentia.


Four Yemenis were sentenced to two years each for helping the
Saudis to obtain the false papers. A fifth was released on time
served, while three other Yemeni defendants were acquitted.


Prosecutors said they would appeal against the verdicts,
particularly the acquittals.
