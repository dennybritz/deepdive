Paul McCartney's estranged wife Heather Mills broke down in tears
during a radio interview on Tuesday, denying she had only married
the fabulously wealthy former Beatle for his money.


The 39-year-old former model's tears came during an appearance on
Los Angeles' KIIS FM radio, when a caller to a phone-in show rang
to say that media portrayals of Mills as a "gold-digger" were
unfair.


Mills, who has wowed viewers on hit US television show "Dancing
With the Stars," where she has performed athletic dance routines
despite having an artificial leg, said she was shocked at her
treatment in the press.


"I could have gone down that path of lowering myself to everyone
else's level ... and proven my innocence," she said, referring to
the media coverage following her split with McCartney in May last
year.


"All I did was fall in love with somebody -- madly -- and give up
my life for seven years, you know.... and then to be vilified for
it? I'm actually quite shocked."


Mills added, "If I was a gold digger, I would be a very wealthy
woman now ... and I'm not."


Mills, who has a three-year-old daughter with McCartney, is
locked in divorce proceedings with the 64-year-old music legend.


McCartney and Mills appeared in court in London on March 1 for a
preliminary hearing in their divorce.


One press report said McCartney, whose fortune is estimated at
between 800 million and one billion dollars, is planning to offer
a 25-million-pound (38 -million-euro, 49-million-dollar)
settlement to end the bitter divorce battle.
