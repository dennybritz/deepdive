David Beckham returned to training with Real Madrid on Tuesday,
almost a month to the day since he strained a ligament in his
right knee in a game against Getafe on March 4.


The former England captain has missed the last four of the
Spanish giant's matches - three in La Liga and the Champions
League last 16 second leg against Bayern Munich - as well losing
the chance for an England recall.


Real would not comment on whether they expect Beckham to be fit
for Sunday's crucial league match at home to Osasuna.


However, if fit, he is likely to start as Real's Spanish
international midfielder Jose Maria Gutierrez is suspended after
being sent off in their 2-1 win at Celta Vigo on Sunday.


After some erratic performances in the middle of the season Real
are now unbeaten in seven league matches and lie third in the
Spanish title race, five points behind the league leaders and
their bitter rivals Barcelona.


The Spanish league title is Beckham's last chance to win a major
honour with Real before he leaves for Los Angeles Galaxy at the
end of the season, after going empty-handed since coming to the
Spanish capital in the summer of 2003.
