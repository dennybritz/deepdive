Nigeria will auction 45 oil exploration blocs on May 3, a mixture
of Niger Basin, deep offshore and inland basin fields, Energy
Minister Edmund Daukoru said Tuesday.


Nigeria regularly puts exploration fields up for auction to
foreign and domestic bidders. This latest bidding round has been
postponed several times since late 2006.


"We are going to hold the bidding round conference on May 3 and
sign the production sharing agreements two weeks later," said
Tony Chukwueke, the director of the department of petroleum
resources.


The government had previously said it intended to auction some 60
blocs in this next round but Daukoru said time constraints had
obliged the government to limit the number.


Blocs are supposed to be sold to the highest bidder.


But in reality, observers say, the government has already
expressed its preference for investors who are willing, in
exchange for exploration rights on blocs, to invest in the
downstream sector, for example by building a refinery.


Asian countries such as China and India are often willing to do
this, while Western oil majors tend not to be.


Nigeria, which derives more than 95 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings from oil, normally produces about 2.6 million
barrels of crude per day.


In the past several months however, unrest in the Niger delta has
cut back output by around one quarter.
