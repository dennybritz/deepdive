Romania's Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu won parliamentary
approval for his newly reshuffled government Tuesday but his
minority coalition faces an uncertain future.


Tariceanu won his vote by 303 against 27 after the Democrat
Party, whose ministers the prime minister had sacked as part of
his reshuffle, left when the vote was called.


The Democrat Party is considered close to President Traian
Basescu, with whom Tariceanu has been locked in a long-running
political battle.


Tariceanu has said he decided on the reshuffle in a bid to break
the political deadlock caused by his conflict with the president.


Basescu himself on Monday denounced the proposed new government
as flying in the face of the 2004 parliamentary elections
results.


The new cabinet includes members of Tariceanu's National Liberal
Party as well as the Democratic Union of Romanian Magyars (UDMR),
which represents the country's Hungarian minority.


But with only 105 seats out of a total 469 in parliament, the
prime minister will need to keep the support of the 150 seats of
the opposition Social Democrat Party (PSD) if it is to survive.


"We voted in favour of the government, but we remain a party of
opposition, intransigent," PSD leader Mircea Geoana warned
Tuesday.


Tried and tested ministers sacked in the reshuffle will be
replaced by relative newcomers to this level of politics.


A 30-year-old lawyer, Tudor Chiuariu, will have to fill the shoes
of Monica Macovei, the popular justice minister credited with
being one of the main architects of Romania's successful bid for
European Union membership.
