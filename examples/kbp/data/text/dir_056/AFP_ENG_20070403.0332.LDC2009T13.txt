German automobile sales continued to fall sharply in March as a
result of the rise in value-added or sales tax (VAT) that took
effect at the start of the year, the VDA auto federation said on
Tuesday.


The number of new car registrations -- a key yardstick of
domestic demand in the sector -- fell by 6.0 percent to 338,000
vehicles this month, it said in a statement.


"As expected, the domestic car market continued to feel the
effects of the VAT hike in March," VDA said.


New car registrations this year have been distorted by the
statistical effects" connected with the VAT hike, which had led
customers to bring forward big-ticket purchases to earlier
months.


Thus, the last two months of 2006 saw a veritable explosion in
new car registrations, largely owing to the VAT effect, with new
registrations zooming ahead by 18 percent in both November and
December.


The German government raised VAT by three full percentage points
to 19 percent with effect from January 1.


By contrast, export sales rose by 5.0 percent to 416,500 cars in
March, VDA calculated.


And a total of 567,300 cars rolled off the production lines last
month, up 4.0 percent on the year, VDA said.


Taking the first three months of 2007 as a whole, new car
registrations slumped by 10 percent to 720,900 cars, while export
sales were up 12 percent at 1.164 million vehicles in the first
quarter.


A total 1.527 million cars rolled off German production lines in
the January- March period, up 7.0 percent on the year, VDA said.
