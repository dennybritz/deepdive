A bomb blast in the Colombian Pacific port city of Buenaventura
Tuesday left a civilian dead and two military personnel injured,
naval authorities said.


The man killed may have touched the explosive device, which went
off accidentally when navy officials were doing an early morning
search, officials said, noting the intent may have been to
detonate it just as the military patrol passed by.


So far this year the post city has been rocked by five bomb
attacks, which have killed a total of 20 people and left another
39 injured.


Authorities have blamed the explosions on the leftist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
