Rain and a wet outfield delayed the start of the World Cup Super
Eights match between South Africa and Ireland at the Guyana
National Stadium here on Tuesday.


Heavy overnight rain had left the ground wet and groundsmen were
forced to put the covers back after light showers forced the toss
to be delayed.


Officials said the toss is expected to be held at 9:30 local time
(13:30GMT) and action will start 15 minutes later.


South Africa have two points from their one-wicket win over Sri
Lanka in the Super Eights. Ireland lost their first Super Eights
matach by 48 runs against England.
