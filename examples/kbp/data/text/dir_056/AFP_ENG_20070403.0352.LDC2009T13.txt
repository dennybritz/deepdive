At least nine people were injured in a grenade attack Tuesday at
a crowded marketplace in the restive northeast India state of
Assam, officials said.


"Nine people were wounded, two of them seriously in the grenade
attack," Rajen Singh, deputy police chief of Assam's Guwahati
city told AFP.


Singh said police suspected the involvement of militants from the
outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), which has been
fighting for an independent homeland since 1979.


The injured, mostly shoppers and vendors, were taken to hospital,
he said.


The ULFA warned last week that it will step up attacks, including
using suicide bombers.


"The freedom fighters (ULFA cadres) have reached such a stage
they would strap bombs on their chest and attack," ULFA chairman
Arabinda Rajkhowa said in a statement Thursday.


The outfit also rejected Assam government's offer for
unconditional talks.


More than 10,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in
Assam during the past two decades.
