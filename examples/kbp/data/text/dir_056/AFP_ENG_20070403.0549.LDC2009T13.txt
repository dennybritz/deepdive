Nearly 140 people have been killed and some 45,000 displaced
after a series of land clashes in Kenya's western region over the
past six months, Kenya's main women's rights group said Tuesday.


"The women of Kenya are concerned about the ongoing conflict in
Mount Elgon and the effects on women and children," the
Maelendeleo ya Wanamake group said in a statement.


"Reports indicate that 137 people have died and approximately
45,000 have been displaced as a result."


Local health workers said at least six people were killed over
the weekend when a local group called Sabaot Land Defence Forces
(SLDF) attacked villagers near the border with Uganda.


Attacks flared up in the area in late 2006 when the SLDF demanded
the nullification of a government settlement scheme in which they
were displaced from their ancestral land, claiming the land was
redistributed unfairly.


Disagreements over land have been a source of clashes in recent
years in Kenya, with rival tribes fighting pitched battles to
control it.


The government has been accused of favouring certain tribes in
the distribution of land.


President Mwai Kibaki's government, which came to come to power
in 2003, has failed to make progress in addressing the land
issue, despite it being one of its key pre-election pledges ahead
of polls in December.
