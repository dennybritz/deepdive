Leicester prop Marcos Ayerza faces an anxious time to see whether
he can play in the European Cup semi-final after he was cited for
violence on Tuesday.


The 24-year-old Argentinian international was cited for an
incident that occurred during Sunday's thrilling 21-20 victory
over French side Stade Francais.


If the 11-times capped Ayerza is found guilty he risks being
suspended for the April 21 semi-final with Welsh outfit Llanelli.


No date was fixed for the hearing.
