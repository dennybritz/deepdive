A consortium of companies headed by German airport operator
Fraport has won the contract to operate the new airport being
built in the Senegalese capital of Dakar, Fraport announced on
Tuesday.


Fraport, which operates Frankfurt airport, Europe's second-
busiest after London Heathrow, said in a statement that the
consortium would operate Dakar's new airport for a period of 25
years.


The foundation stone was scheduled to be laid on Wednesday, with
the airport scheduled to be completed in 2010/2011.


The international banks providing the financing for the project
had indicated they would only do so if the management of the
airport were placed in "professional hands," Fraport said.


The German-led consortium had beaten off fierce foreign
competition for the contract, it said.


Fraport's own experts were already in the process of optimising
flight timetables and would accompany the building work.


They would also organise the move from the existing airport to
the new one, Fraport said.


Dakar's current airport, which is serviced by airlines such as
Air France, Spain's Iberia, and South African Airways, handles
about 1.5 million passengers a year, the company said.


Passenger numbers are projected to rise to around five million
annually.
