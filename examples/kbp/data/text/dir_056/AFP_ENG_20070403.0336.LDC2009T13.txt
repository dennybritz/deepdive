Who's saying what at the 2007 cricket World Cup:


"It's driven me since my first tour of Australia (in 2001-02),
it's always been a goal to be the number one bowler in the
world."


- New Zealand paceman Shane Bond on his ambitions.


"It's a little bit frustrating - but I still believe in my
players. They have shown they have the talent and the
capabilities to get top runs."


- Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar on his team's batting
failures in the Super Eights.


"We lost two bowlers and to get them out for 174 was a great
effort. It was very impressive. The players who have been in form
continue to be in form."


- Black Caps captain Stephen Fleming praising his patched-up side
after maintaining their 100-percent record.


"He's a really happy guy, a nice guy - I call him the silent
assassin - he has so much talk on the cricket ball he doesn't
have to say much."


- Kevin Pietersen on the dangers England will face from Muttiah
Muralitharan.


"The media has set on us as being party poopers."


- Ireland coach Adrian Birrell upset that his side are not being
taken seriously."
