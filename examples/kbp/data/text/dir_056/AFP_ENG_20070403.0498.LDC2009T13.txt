A restaurant owner in southern China paid 580,000 yuan (75,000
dollars) for a giant golden fish, a traditional symbol of wealth
and good luck, state media reported on Tuesday.


The huge fish, which measured 1.75 metres (five feet 10 inches)
long and weighed 49 kilograms (108 pounds) was caught on Sunday
off Zhanjiang along the coast of the southern province of
Guangdong, the semi-official China News Service said.


It did not specify the species but said it was a rare specimen.
