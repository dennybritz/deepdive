The ashes of a Japanese writer who translated works by Bosnian
Nobel prize- winner Ivo Andric have been scattered over the river
mentioned in his most famous book.


Kazuo Tanaka had visited the eastern town of Visegrad, the scene
of Andric's famous novel "The Bridge on the Drina", several
times, the last being in 2005 on the 30th anniversary of Andric's
death, local media said Tuesday.


Part of his ashes was also scattered in Belgrade into the Danube
river. In his will, the writer said he wanted his soul to remain
in those two rivers.


Tanaka translated all the works by Andric, who was born in Bosnia
but spent the second half of his life in Belgrade declaring
himself a Serb, as well as the works of a number of other Serbian
writers.


Andric won a Nobel prize for literature in 1961, following the
publication of "The Bridge on the Drina", in which he wrote about
Ottoman times in Bosnia through relations between its Muslim and
Orthodox Serb inhabitants.
