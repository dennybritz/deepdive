US challenger BMW Oracle on Tuesday won the first regatta of Act
13 of the Louis-Vuitton Cup, ahead of South Africa's Team
Shosholoza and Mascalzone Latino of Italy.


America's Cup holders Alinghi of Switzerland finished fourth with
a second regatta scheduled later Tuesday.


Act 13 is the final preliminary heat for sport's oldest prize
held here this week.


This week's heat will see the 11 boats hoping to win the right to
take on Alinghi in the head-to-head for yachting's most
prestigious prize before the start of the competition proper.


That comes on April 16 with the Louis-Vuitton Cup which will
determine which boat goes through to the 32nd America's Cup match
race against Alinghi which begins on June 23.
