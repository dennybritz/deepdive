US President George W. Bush said Tuesday that US troops will
suffer if the deadlock with the US Congress over war funding
continues.


If Congress did not approve a war funding bill "if they do not
change course in the coming weeks, the price of that failure will
be paid by our troops and their loved ones," Bush told reporters.


"The bottom line is this, Congress's failure to fund our troops
on the front line also mean that some of our military families
could wait longer for their loved ones to return from the front
lines," Bush said.


"And others can see their loved ones headed back to the war
sooner than they need to. That is unacceptable to me, and I
believe it is unacceptable to the American people."
