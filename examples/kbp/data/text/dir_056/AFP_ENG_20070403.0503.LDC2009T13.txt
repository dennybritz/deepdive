Japan on Tuesday urged China to help secure the release of
millions of dollars claimed by North Korea which has held up
nuclear disarmament talks until the funds are transferred.


"There are several difficult problems involved. So we requested
China to help solve this money transfer issue," Japanese foreign
ministry press secretary Mitsuo Sakaba told a news conference in
New Delhi.


Sakaba said Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso made the request
to his Chinese counterpart Li Zhaoxing during talks on the
sidelines of the South Asian summit, which Tokyo and Beijing are
attending as observers.


US and Chinese officials have been holding talks in Beijing over
how to arrange the return to North Korea of about 25 million
dollars frozen in a Macau bank by US financial sanctions in 2005
due to accusations of money laundering and counterfeiting.


Pyongyang has been demanding the money before it will cooperate
further on a new North Korean nuclear disarmament accord it
signed in February.


The United States has agreed to free up the funds, which were
supposed to be transferred within a month after the February 13
nuclear deal was signed to a North Korean account with the Bank
of China.


However, the state-owned lender has reportedly refused to accept
the money for fear of possibly affecting its credit rating.
