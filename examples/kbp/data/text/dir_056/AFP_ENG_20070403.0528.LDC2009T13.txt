General Motors Corp. saw US sales fall 7.7 percent to 349,867
vehicles in March after a planned reduction in sales to rental
car companies, the automaker said Tuesday.


Sales for the first quarter of 2007 fell 5.6 percent to 909,094
vehicles, the US automaker said.


Retail sales, however, were up 0.5 percent for the quarter while
fleet sales fell significantly on the back of a reduction of
nearly 60,000 vehicles sold to rental companies.


"As we continue to build upon our strategy of focusing on value,
lowering daily rental sales and increasing residual values, we
were able to grow retail sales for the quarter, posting year-
over-year increases in 19 vehicle lines," said Mark LaNeve, vice
president, GM North American sales, service and marketing.


"That's very good news. In March, we saw continued strength and
stability in our retail business led by gains in mid-cars,
crossovers, economy cars and luxury SUVs."


Truck sales fell significantly in March, down an adjusted 11.3
percent at 213,001 vehicles while car sales were nearly flat,
down 1.4 percent at 136,866 vehicles.


GM revised downward its forecast for North American production in
the second quarter of 2007 by 1.3 percent to 1.16 million
vehicles.


Production schedules were revised upward slightly for the second
quarter in Europe to 473,000 vehicles and also in Asia Pacific
where the forecast was revised up to 568,000 vehicles. The
forecast was revised down slightly in Latin America, Africa and
the Middle East to 222,000 units.
