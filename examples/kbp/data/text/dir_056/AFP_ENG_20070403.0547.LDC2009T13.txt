Czech WWII war hero and president of the Association of Former
Combatants, Antonin Spacek, died Tuesday aged 89, Czech public
television said.


Present at the D-Day landings in France in June 1944, Spacek was
awarded the Legion d'Honneur at the commemorations 60 years later
by French President Jacques Chirac.


A lieutenant in the Czechoslovakian army before the war, Spacek
quit his country when the Nazis occupied his homeland to
eventually join free Czechoslovakian units in France after a long
journey through Europe, Asia and Africa.


He feld to Britain after the fall of France, returning four years
later with an armoured Czechoslovakian brigade which landed in
Normandy.


More than 50,000 Czech and Slovaks served with the allies during
WWII.


In 1949, Spacek was condemned to 10 years in prison by the
communist regime which grabbed power one year earlier and was
forced to work in a uranium mine for many years.


Following the overthow of communism during the "Velvet
Revolution" in 1989, he was promoted to the rank of general and
took up his top post with the association of former combatants in
2001.
