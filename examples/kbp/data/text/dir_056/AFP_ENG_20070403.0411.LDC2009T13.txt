A German court ruled Tuesday that a daughter cannot have her late
father's ashes pressed into a diamond because she had failed to
prove it was his dying wish.


The court in Wiesbaden in southwestern Germany upheld a claim by
the man's widow who was opposed to her daughter's plans to send
his ashes to Switzerland to have a "memorial" diamond made.


It based its ruling on testimony from the man's brother-in-law
who visited a family grave with him shortly before his death from
cancer last year.


He allegedly remarked that he too would soon be buried there,
casting doubt on the daughter's claim.


"With such an exotic form of interment, and one that is illegal
in Germany, there is an onus to prove that the deceased really
wanted this," the court said in its judgement.


The technique for turning the dead's ashes into diamonds
originated in the United States but the practice is becoming
popular in parts of Europe.
