Five decayed bodies were found in an old house in a southern
Japanese city Tuesday but police did not immediately find signs
of foul play.


The bodies -- which were either skeletons or mummified -- were
discovered in a one-storey wooden house in a residential area
near the central train station of Omuta, on the southern main
island of Kyushu, police said.


"We need post mortems to determine the causes and timings of the
deaths. We are in the process of investigating whether there is
any criminal nature in the deaths," a spokeswoman for the Omuta
police station said.


"The bodies, either skeletal or mummified, are presumed to be
those of adults but their genders are unknown," she told AFP by
telephone. "We are trying to ascertain their identities."


The house, which looked dilapidated with broken roof tiles and
untidy fences on television footage, belonged to Shigeo Nagae, a
man in his 90s.


The discovery of the bodies followed inquiries from local
residents about Nagae and his family who had not been seen for
several years, press reports said.


The bodies were found in a number of rooms at the house and some
of them were in beds. They were in different stages of
decomposition, indicating that the deaths came at different
times, reports said.
