International Red Cross chief Jakob Kellenberger on Tuesday
started a visit to Washington for talks about US-held "war on
terror" prisoners at the Guantanamo detention camp, a spokesman
said.


The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross is
to meet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defence Secretary
Robert Gates and other top US officials during the three-day
visit, the ICRC said in a statement.


Committee spokesman Vincent Lusser said the talks would focus on
the 400 detainees at the camp, many of whom have now been held
for more than five years without being charged.


The ICRC has been allowed to carry out about 40 visits to the
camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to inspect conditions and has
delivered about 8,000 messages from the detainees and their
families, Lusser said.


ICRC activities in Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories
and events in Afghanistan and Sudan were also to be discussed by
Kellenberger in Washington, his spokesman said.
