Romania's Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu won parliamentary
approval for his new government on Tuesday, thanks to backing
from opposition Social Democrats, but his minority coalition
faces an uncertain future.


The parliament voted 303 to 27 in favor of Tariceanu's team after
the Democrat Party, whose ministers the prime minister had sacked
in a government reshuffle, left when the vote was called.


The Democrats are considered close to President Traian Basescu,
who is locked in a long-running political battle with Tariceanu.


Tariceanu has said he decided to reshuffle the gpvernment in a
bid to break the political deadlock caused by his conflict with
the president.


Basescu himself on Monday denounced the proposed new government
as flying in the face of the 2004 parliamentary elections
results.


The new cabinet includes members of Tariceanu's National Liberal
Party as well as the Democratic Union of Romanian Magyars (UDMR),
which represents the country's Hungarian minority.


But with only 105 seats out of a total 469 in parliament, the
prime minister will need to keep the support of the 150 seats of
the opposition Social Democrat Party (PSD) if it is to survive.


"We voted in favour of the government, but we remain a party of
opposition, instransigent," PSD leader Mircea Geoana warned
Tuesday.
