Customs officers found 175 chameleons and 10 turtles at Zagreb
airport being smuggled from Thailand by a Croatian man, police
said Tuesday.


The chameleons belonging to protected species Calumma globifer
and Calumma parsonii were in very bad condition, and seven of
them had already died during transport, the Hina news agency
reported.


The value of the chameleons was estimated at around 150,000 euros
(200,000 dollars). Authorities said they would press charges
against the 25 year-old.
