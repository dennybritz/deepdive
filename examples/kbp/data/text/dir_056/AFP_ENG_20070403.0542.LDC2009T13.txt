Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has hired a team of consultants to
carry out the first-ever audit of carbon emissions from her three
official residences, a spokesman for Buckingham Palace said
Tuesday.


"For the first time, we are doing an overall audit to take stock
on our carbon emissions and our energy consumption in the queen's
royal residences, not in the private estates," a spokeswoman
said.


"We will know where and how to reduce our emissions."


The review includes Buckingham Palace in London, Windsor Castle,
just west of the capital -- where the queen spends weekends --
and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, her Scottish
official residence.


Her other homes, including Balmoral in the Scottish Highlands and
Sandringham in eastern England, are private residences.


The spokeswoman said that the royal household had been "taking
environmental measures" for over 10 years but there had never
been an overall audit.


The results of the audit will not be made public, she added.


Green measures already taken by the palace include converting all
vehicles of state used by the queen -- plus a London taxi driven
by her husband Prince Philip -- to run on LPG (liquified
petroleum gas).


Prince Charles, heir to the throne, is known for his interest in
green issues but has recently taken flak from the British press
for the amount he travels by air.
