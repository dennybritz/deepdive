Ireland were 63-3 after 20 overs of their rain-interrupted World
Cup Super Eights match against South Africa at the Guyana
National Stadium here on Tuesday.


After two lengthy rain delays, the match had been reduced to
35-overs-a-side.


Niall O'Brien was 16 not out with Andrew White was on nought.


Opener Jeremy Bray fell lbw to Shaun Pollock for nought in the
third over before William Porterfield became the second batsman
out, caught by Jacques Kallis at extra cover off Pollock for 14.


Eoin Morgan was the third man out in the 20th over caught by
Ashwell Prince off Andrew Hall for 28 with the score on 23.


South Africa brought back batsman Prince in place of spinner
Robin Peterson from their line-up which beat Sri Lanka by one
wicket in their first Super Eights match last week.


Ireland, who lost their first Super Eights match to England,
brought in Paul Mooney for Kevin O'Brien.
