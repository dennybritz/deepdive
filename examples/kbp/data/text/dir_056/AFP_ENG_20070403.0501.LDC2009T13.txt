Ford Motor Company's problems continued in March as sales fell a
monthly nine percent to 264,975 vehicles, largely on the back on
weak truck sales and a planned reduction in sales to rental car
companies.


Sales for the first quarter of the year are now down 13.2 percent
at 642,960 vehicles, the US automaker reported.


Car sales were down 14.6 percent at 89,484 vehicles compared with
March 2006 and truck sales down 5.8 percent at 175,491 vehicles.


Strong sales in midsized crossover vehicles offset further
weakness in Ford's critical F-series pickup truck, which fell 15
percent to 71,481 vehicles in March.


Ford said it expected F-series sales to improve as it rolls out
the all-new 2008 Super Duty model and noted that March sales were
the highest volume since August 2006.


Ford did see a sharp increase of mid-sized sedan sales in March,
as new models posted at 40 percent growth to 24,094 units.


"Ford is moving quickly to operate profitably at lower volumes
and a changed mix, and we are encouraged our retail market share
appears to be stabilizing over the past several months," Mark
Fields, Ford's president of the Americas division, said in a
statement.


"We remain committed to offering more of the products that our
customers really want, and the popularity of our new cars and
crossovers is proof we're delivering."
