Consumer prices in Turkey rose by 0.92 percent in March from the
previous month to reach 10.86 percent on an annual basis, the
Turkish Statistics Institute said Tuesday.


Producer prices, meanwhile, rose by 0.97 percent from February to
March, bringing wholesale inflation for the year to 10.92
percent, the institute said.


Inflation in 2006 was 9.65 percent, nearly double the year-end
target of 5.0 percent set in an IMF-backed austerity programme.


Authorities however remain optimistic that the 2007 target of 4.0
percent remains within reach provided tight monetary policies are
implemented.


Fighting inflation is a key element in a three-year economic
stability programme that Turkey is implementing with the support
of a 10-billion-dollar (7.5 -billion-euro) loan from the
International Monetary Fund.


IMF-backed tight financial policies have helped the government
beat inflation targets over the past three years, bringing the
rate from 29.7 percent in 2002 to 7.7 percent in 2005.
