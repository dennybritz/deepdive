Former West Indies all-rounder Phil Simmons, who takes over as
Ireland coach after the World Cup, says the hosts can learn a lot
from the Irish part-timers.


"There's more zip and enthusiasm from Ireland, who have nothing
to lose than from West Indies, who have a lot to lose," Simmons
told the BBC.


"If you play in the World Cup in your home country, I don't see
more motivation than that."


Simmons has a close interest in the form of the West Indies team.


Not only is he a former Test and one-day international player, he
is also the uncle of Lendl Simmons whose selection for West
Indies' defeat against New Zealand caused a split in the Windies'
ranks.


Simmons said he was unimpressed with West Indies' poor display in
the field when they allowed Sri Lanka to post 303-5 in a 113-run
loss on Sunday, a defeat which has virtually killed off the
hosts' chances of making the semi-finals.


"It's going to be hard, and after two games in three days they
would have been tired, but sometimes you play back-to-back one-
dayers and come out on top," said Simmons.
