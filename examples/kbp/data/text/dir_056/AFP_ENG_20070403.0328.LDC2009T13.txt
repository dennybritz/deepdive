Croatia, Italy, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia pledged Tuesday to
boost cooperation on a plan to build a 1,300-kilometer-long (806
-mile-long) oil pipeline that would link the Black Sea with
Italy.


Economy ministers and state secretaries of the five countries
voiced their "support for the enhancement of cooperation between
the countries of the Pan- European pipeline (PEOP) route and
those other countries that have expressed their interest in the
PEOP project," a declaration signed here said.


"This project providing for the transport of oil from ... the
Black Sea to European market is a strategic project for both
Croatia and all the countries through which it (pipeline) will
go," Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said after the document was
signed.


The pipeline, linking the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta
and the Italian Adriatic port of Trieste, is worth between two to
3.5 billion dollars (1.5 to 2.6 billion euros), he added.


"Today we made the first important step ... We believe that we
will soon start with realization of the project," Sanader said.


European Union Commissioner for energy Andris Piebalgs, who co-
signed the declaration, stressed the EU's support for the
project, proposed back in 2002.


The pipleline would have the capacity to transport 80 to 100
million tonnes of crude oil annually.


The declaration was signed on the sidelines of a one-day meeting
on energy security, potential and investment in south-eastern
Europe.
