Iraq on Tuesday reiterated that it was negotiating with the US
authorities to secure the release of five Iranians detained in
the northern city of Arbil.


Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said that discussions with the US
embassy and the military were under way to free the five
officials detained since January 11.


"We have been asking actually the Americans formally to release
them for quite some time but still they have not been released,"
Zebari told AFP.


The US military detained the five in Arbil saying that they were
suspected of aiding insurgents in Iraq against its troops.


Zebari categorically denied that Iraq was trying to secure the
release of the Iranians in a bid to help free 15 British sailors
detained by Tehran.


"This had nothing to do with that. I want to make that absolutely
clear. This has no linkage with the British sailors," Zebari
said.


"Our efforts here to ensure the release of the Iranians in Arbil
have nothing to do with the detention by the Iranians of the
British sailors. This has been an ongoing attempt by us to secure
their release."


Meanwhile, the Iranian embassy confirmed that diplomat Jalal
Sharafi was freed on Monday after two months of captivity.


Sharafi, second secretary at the mission, was kidnapped by armed
men dressed in Iraqi army uniforms in central Baghdad on February
4.


Zebari said his disappearance was "mysterious."


"We pursued it (abduction) with all the relevant authorities," he
said including the US authorities adding that only Sharafi knew
about his case.


The US military said it had nothing to do with Sharafi's case.
