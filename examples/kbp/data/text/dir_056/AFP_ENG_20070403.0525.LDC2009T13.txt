A private US delegation led by New Mexico Governor Bill
Richardson will visit North Korea April 8-11 to aid in the return
of US soldiers' remains, the White House said Tuesday.


Richardson, a 2008 Democratic presidential hopeful, and
Republican former veterans affairs secretary Anthony Principi
will lead the group, which will travel there at North Korea's
invitation, said spokeswoman Dana Perino.


"The United States Government has invested considerable energy in
persuading the DPRK (North Korea) to adhere to the provisions of
the Armistice Agreement that cover repatriation of remains," she
said in a statement.


"This trip will reinforce progress already achieved in this area.
A small number of US officials will accompany the delegation to
provide support and technical expertise," she said.


In June 2005, North Korea declared a permanent end to US recovery
work of the remains of US soldiers killed during the 1950-1953
Korean War after the US military temporarily suspended such
operations citing safety concerns tied to uncertain political
developments.
