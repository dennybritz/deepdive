US President George W. Bush warned Tuesday that a nuclear-armed
Iran would be "a seriously destabilizing influence in the Middle
East" and vowed to keep working to prevent it.


"I firmly believe that, if Iran were to have a nuclear weapon, it
would be a seriously destabilizing influence in the Middle East,"
Bush said during a question-and-answer session with reporters at
the White House.


"And therefore we have worked to build an international coalition
to try to convince the Iranians to give up their weapon, make it
clear that they have choices to make," said the president.
