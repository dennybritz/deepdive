New Zealand's World Cup campaign received a boost on Tuesday when
batsman Ross Taylor said he was hopeful of recovering from a
hamstring injury in time to face Ireland next Monday.


Taylor has missed the last three matches due to the injury
although the Black Caps have still remained unbeaten to maintain
their 100-percent record in the tournament and stay comfortably
on course for the semi-finals.


"For the last few days I have been gradually increasing my
workload at practice, starting with a few gentle stretching
exercises to the point where I am now starting to stretch out
fully," said Taylor.


"I'm hopeful of being ready for Ireland in Guyana in a week's
time.


"I had a similar injury a few years ago and then I tried to rush
my recover and tweaked it again, setting me back an extra week. I
certainly don't want to do it that again."
