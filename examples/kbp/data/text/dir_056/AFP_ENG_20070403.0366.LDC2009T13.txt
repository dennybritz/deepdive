US President George W. Bush on Tuesday warned that US House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Syria sent "mixed signals" that
undermine US-led efforts to isolate Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad.


Speaking as Pelosi kicked off a two-day visit to Damascus, Bush
also pointed out that a parade of US and European officials have
met with Assad, "and yet we haven't seen action" on issues like
Lebanon and Iraq.
