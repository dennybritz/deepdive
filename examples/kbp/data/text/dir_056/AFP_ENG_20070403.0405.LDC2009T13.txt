Russian Vice-President Sergei Ivanov on Tuesday urged Russians to
boycott Estonian products in protest against the Baltic state's
decision to move a Soviet monument in Tallinn.


"Do not buy Estonian products," said Ivanov during a meeting of
war veteran associations in Moscow, according to Interfax news
agency.


"Do not go to Estonia, instead go to Kaliningrad," the Russian
enclave between fellow Baltic state Lithuania and Poland, he
said.


"The state should speak out against this vandalism. And it is the
foreign ministry and the Duma (the Russian parliament) that
should play the main role," he said.


Ivanov, who has been touted as a possible successor to Russian
President Vladimir Putin in 2008, added that Estonia's actions
"would not go by without leaving their mark on Russo-Estonian
relations."


Moscow has already threatened sanctions over the Estonian
parliament's plan to remove a towering bronze statue of a Red
Army soldier from its prominent position in the capital Tallinn
to another location.


For many Estonians, the statue is seen as a painful reminder of
Soviet occupation, but it was condemned as an "act of blasphemy"
by Russia. In the end, Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves
vetoed the plan.


Estonia was taken over by Stalin's Soviet Union after the Red
Army drove out occupying German forces at the end of World War
II. It remained part of the USSR until 1991.
