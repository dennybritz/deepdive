Former Spice Girl Melanie Brown gave birth to a baby girl early
Tuesday, her representatives confirmed in a statement to
celebrity news websites.


The 31-year-old's new arrival was born shortly after midnight at
Saint John's Hospital in Santa Monica, west of Los Angeles,
weighing in at 5 lb 4 oz (2.4 kilograms).


"The baby is completely healthy with a good head of hair," a rep
for Brown said in a statement quoted by People Magazine's online
edition.


"Mother and baby are now resting. No name has been decided on as
yet and she is purely known as Baby Brown."


Brown, better known as "Scary Spice," already has an eight-year-
old daughter, Phoenix Chi, the product of her marriage to ex-
husband Jimmy Gulzar.


However the paternity of her new arrival has been the subject of
intense speculation in the tabloid press.


Brown has said ex-boyfriend and "Dreamgirls" star Eddie Murphy is
the father although the veteran funnyman has questioned that
claim.


"I don't know whose child that is until it comes out and has a
blood test," Murphy told Dutch television last year.


Brown later said she was "distressed" by Murphy's comments.
