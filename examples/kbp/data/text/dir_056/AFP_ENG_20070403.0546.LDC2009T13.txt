In what has become as much an annual rite of spring as the
Masters, US lawmakers are considering a bill to remove tax breaks
for expenses at male-only enclaves like Augusta National Golf
Club.


US representative Carolyn Maloney introduced the bill before the
US Congress with specific mention of Augusta National, host club
for this week's 71st Masters, the year's first major golf
championship.


"Golf courses are set up to allow fair competition between men
and women. But at the Augusta National clubhouse, men have long
had an unfair advantage," Maloney said.


"Men who belong to clubs like Augusta National reap financial
benefits - either directly through tax deductions for business
expenses or indirectly through career opportunities and board
appointments - that women can't get just because they are women.


"The American taxpayer shouldn't be subsidizing discrimination.
These unfair writeoffs should be driven off the golf course and
out of the tax code."


Maloney was among the supporters of Martha Burk, whose protest
outside of Augusta National in 2003 fizzled and brought a firm
rebuke from the club's then- chairman Hootie Johnson.


Pressure upon Masters corporate sponsors by women's groups has
not yet yieled a woman as a member of the club.


But there is a new man in charge at Augusta National, Johnson
having been replaced by Billy Payne, the spearhead of Atlanta's
successful 1996 Olympic bid.


"I urge Mr. Payne to rethink his club's policy of discrimination
against 51 percent of the American people," Maloney said.
