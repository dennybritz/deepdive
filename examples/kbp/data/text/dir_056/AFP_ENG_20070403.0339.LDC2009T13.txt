Former Argentine president Isabel Peron on Tuesday formally
opposed moves to extradite her from Spain back home on charges
relating to her alleged collaboration with right-wing death
squads.


Tuesday's extradition motion was based on an Argentinian
investigation into her alleged involvement with the right-wing
"Triple A" death squad (Argentine Anti- Communist Alliance).


The group, which has been accused of carrying out 1,500 murders
in the 1970s, was active during the 1973-1974 presidency of
Isabel Peron's husband, Juan Domingo Peron, and during her own
1974-1976 rule.


Last Tuesday, Peron, 75, objected to a separate extradition
request relating to the kidnapping and disappearance of activist
Hector Fagetti Gallego.


He was arrested a month before the March 1976 military coup that
ousted her from power and was never seen again.


Peron, who has lived in Spain since 1981, was briefly arrested in
January after Argentina obtained an international arrest warrant.
She was subsquently put under house arrest.


If the court rules in favour of extradition, the final decision
will rest with the Spanish government.
