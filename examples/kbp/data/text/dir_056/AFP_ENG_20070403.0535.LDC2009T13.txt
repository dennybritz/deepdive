Italian energy group Enel expects to conclude its joint takeover
of Spanish utility Endesa before the end of July, Enel chief
executive Fulvio Conti said Tuesday.


He said Enel, with partner Acciona, a Spanish construction
company, would file their joint bid with the Spanish market
regulator CNMV between April 16-20.


He also said that there were no overlaps between the companies
which would create anti-trust problems.


"I don't expect there to be any major issue on the antitrust
front," he told a conference call.


Enel and Acciona control about 46 percent of Endesa.


German energy group E.ON announced on Monday that it had
abandoned its takeover bid for Endesa after reaching an agreement
with Enel and Acciona.


E.ON is to buy assets worth about 10 billion euros (13 billion
dollars) from Endesa.
