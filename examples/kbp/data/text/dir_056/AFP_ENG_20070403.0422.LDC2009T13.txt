A 29-year-old murder mystery in Norway has been solved after a
man came confessed that he stabbed a woman to death but he cannot
be punished, police said.


Inger Johanne Apenes, 61, was murdered in a frenzied knife attack
at her home in Fredrikstad, southeastern Norway in May 1978.


Police interviewed some 4,000 people during their investigation
but the crime remained unsolved until an informer provided new
information leading to the killer.


The murderer, whose name was not released, confessed that as a 14
-year-old he had broken into the woman's home for a burglary
attempt, and had killed Apenes when she discovered him.


"He panicked when he was discovered and that's when the crime
took place," Inspector Geir Kristiansen told reporters.


Despite his confession, the man will not be punished or even
identified because the statute of limitations expired in 2003.


"The affair will never come before a court and we have therefore
decided not to release his identity," Kristiansen said.
