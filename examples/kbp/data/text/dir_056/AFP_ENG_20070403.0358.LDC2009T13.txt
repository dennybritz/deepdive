Bird flu has hit a new commercial poultry farm in the Gulf state
of Kuwait leading to the culling of at least 200,000 more layer
chickens, the health ministry said on Tuesday.


Authorities in the oil-rich emirate said on Saturday that they
have culled 1.5 million fowls, including 1.1 million layer
chickens in three commercial poultry farms in Wafra, south of
Kuwait City on the Saudi border.


Ministry spokesman Ahmad al-Shatti said the number of confirmed
H5N1 virus cases in fowls had risen to 106, but no human cases
had been detected.


The new culling raises the number of layer chickens culled to 1.3
million, which represnts about 75 percent of the emirate's total.


Kuwait also has 32 million broiler chickens, for eating, but no
bird flu case has been found among them.


Since the outbreak was first reported on February 25, Kuwait has
slapped a total ban on the import and export of birds and closed
down bird markets, as well as hundreds of shops that sell live
chickens and the emirate's only zoo.


In November 2005, Kuwait announced the first case of a bird
infected with the deadly H5N1 strain -- a flamingo at a seaside
villa.


The H5N1 strain, the most aggressive form, has killed more than
170 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation,
and seen millions of birds destroyed.


H5N1 is an avian influenza subtype with pandemic potential, since
it might ultimately adapt into a strain that is contagious among
humans.
