Charl Langeveldt took three wickets as Ireland reached a fighting
152-8 in a rain-shortened World Cup Super Eights match against
South Africa at Guyana National Stadium here on Tuesday.


The 32-year-old Langeveldt, who took five wickets in South
Africa's narrow one- wicket win over Sri Lanka last week, led the
attack after Graeme Smith won the toss and put Ireland in.


In a match reduced to 35 overs a side, Andrew White top-scored
with 30 and added 39 for the fifth wicket with Andre Botha (14)
to lift Irish hopes after their tempo was broken by two rain
interruptions of 48 minutes and two hours respectively.


South Africa were set a revised target of 160 off their 35 overs
under the Duckworth-Lewis formula


After the start was delayed by 15 minutes, South Africa's pacemen
exploited the wet and cloudy conditions.


Shaun Pollock dismissed openers Jeremy Bray (nought) and William
Porterfield (14) to finish with 2-17.


Pollock, whose form was a worry after his costly and wicket-less
bowling against Australia and Sri Lanka, now has 377 wickets in
279 matches -- joint fourth on the all-time list with Sri Lanka's
Chaminda Vaas.


Eoin Morgan (28) and Niall O'Brien (25) built the innings through
a 32-run third wicket stand. Morgan hit four boundaries before he
fell off a short Andrew Hall delivery.


Left-hander O'Brien, who made a brilliant 72 in Ireland's three-
wicket win which dumped Pakistan out in the first round, hit four
boundaries before he became the first of Langeveldt's victims.


Langeveldt then dismissed Kyle McCallan and John Mooney off
successive deliveries to finish with 3-41.


Dave Langford-Smith hit out in the slog overs to finish with 17
not out including a four and a six.
