A package containing 98 protected butterfly species from the
Solomon Islands has been intercepted in Serbia, officials said
Tuesday.


"It has been established that they were species listed on the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora, whose trafficking requires licences from both
the exporting and importing country," Serbia's environmental
protection agency said.


Authorities would press smuggling charges against the person who
was supposed to receive the package, it said, adding that the
insects were worth up to 10,000 euros (13,370 dollars).
