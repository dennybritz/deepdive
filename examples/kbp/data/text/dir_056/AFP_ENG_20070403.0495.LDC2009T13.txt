Rain reduced the World Cup Super Eights match between South
Africa and Ireland to 35-over-a-side game as play resumed after a
second rain break at Guyana National Stadium here on Tuesday.


Ireland, who were put in, were 23-1 after heavy rain stopped play
for two hours.


There had already been an earlier 48-minute stoppage while the
start had been delayed by 15 minutes due to overnight and early
morning rain.
