Iran's semi-official Fars news agency on Tuesday published new
photographs of the captured British sailors showing them
"relaxing" in tracksuits and playing chess on a carpet.


A photograph showed the sole female detainee, Faye Turney,
without the Islamic headscarf she had worn in previous
appearances and was also the first time the sailors had been seen
out of military fatigues.


One image showed six sailors sitting on a carpet around a bowl of
food smiling and laughing. Another showed two bent in
concentration over a chess board.


"These latest pictures show their ideal conditions. They are
having fun, relaxing and enjoying food and coffee while playing
chess," the news agency said.
