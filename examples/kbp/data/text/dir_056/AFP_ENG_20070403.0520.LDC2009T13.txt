With international tension building over the crisis in Iran, a
Russian minister and the country's top general warned Tuesday
against military action against the Islamic republic.


"Any military action near our border is unacceptable. We will
take that extremely negatively and everything we can to oppose
it," said Andrei Denissov, at a press conference, the Interfax
agency reported.


Russia has no land border with Iran. But it is one of several
countries that shares part of the Caspian Sea shoreline with the
Islamic republic -- along with the former Soviet republics of
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.


Asked if Russia was worried about possible US air strikes against
Iran, he answered: "Yes, of course."


Meanwhile Russia's chief of staff, General Yuri Baluyevski, said
any military strike against Iran would be a serious political
mistake and would not give victory to the United States.


Washington has been building up its naval military presence in
the Gulf further south.


It now has two aircraft carrier battle group in the region, the
strongest US military presence there since the 2003 invasion of
Iraq.


Washington has persistently denied reports that it is planning
air strikes against Iran.


But US Vice President Dick Cheney, commenting on the crisis over
Iran's nuclear programme, said last February: "It would be a
serious mistake if a nation like Iran were to become a nuclear
power."


He added: "All options are still on the table."


Washington suspects that Iran's civilian nuclear programme will
be used to develop a military nuclear capability.
