Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and EU foreign policy chief
Javier Solana discussed the political crisis here in a telephone
conversation on Tuesday, the president's office said.


"Yushchenko said that now there is a process of consultations
with his prime minister and political forces to enact his order"
to dissolve parliament and hold snap elections, the president's
office said in a statement.


Yushchenko and Solana "agreed that the political crisis has to be
resolved only in a democratic way," the statement said.


The Ukrainian government and parliament have voted to disobey
Yushchenko's order and thousands of protesters in central Kiev
have vowed defiance against the president.


The European Union earlier voiced concern about the political
crisis and called on political leaders in Ukraine to abide by the
constitution in settling their differences.
