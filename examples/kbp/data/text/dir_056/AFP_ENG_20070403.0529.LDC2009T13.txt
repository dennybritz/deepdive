A Canadian woman and an unidentified male of Japanese origin died
in an avalanche in remote northwestern Canada during a helicopter
skiing tour, federal police told AFP Tuesday.


The victims were part of a group of five skiers on a guided
helicopter skiing trip north of Stewart in westernmost British
Columbia province, near the Alaska border.


"We don't know yet if the deceased man is a Japanese citizen or
naturalized Canadian," Corporal Pierre Lemaitre of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) told AFP.


Three other skiers were injured and were evacuated to an area
clinic. One was later transferred to a hospital in Prince Rupert,
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. "The extent of injuries are
not known at this time," Lemaitre said.


Tour operator Last Frontier Heliskiing meanwhile said in a
statement that its rescue efforts began "within minutes" of the
avalanche, and counselors have since been brought in to care for
their guests, staff and their families.


The RCMP said they were notified of the fatal avalanche at 10:55
am Monday (1755 GMT). "Three survivors made it out and advised
that two of their companions were dead," Lemaitre said.


RCMP investigators noted that communications in the remote
mountainous area of British Columbia is very difficult. In order
to search for and recover the bodies they must travel "by land
for two hours, then fly in by helicopter."


The RCMP and the coroner have opened an investigation, but are
assessing possible further dangers of avalanches in the area
before removing the two bodies from the back country.
