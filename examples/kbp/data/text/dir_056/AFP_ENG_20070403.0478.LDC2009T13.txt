British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett urged caution Tuesday
over hopes of a "swift resolution" to the crisis involving 15
naval personnel captured by Iran.


"I would urge you to be cautious in assuming that we are likely
to see a swift resolution to this issue," she told reporters. "We
are not seeking confrontation. We are seeking to pursue this
through diplomatic channels."
