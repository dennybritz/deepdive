Arab League chief Amr Mussa on Tuesday rejected an Israeli
invitation to participate in a regional summit to re-activate the
peace process, describing it as "not serious."


"The letter wasn't serious and offered nothing new," the
secretary general said during a press conference in Cairo with
Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere. "It's only goal was
to get normalisation for free."


Mussa added that the invitation came in the form of a letter from
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to participate in a meeting of
Israelis, Palestinians and "moderate" Arab nations.


He said the rejected the offer because the Israelis wanted to
modify the Arab peace initiative and were describing the return
of Palestinian refugees as a "red line."


Olmert said on Sunday that he was ready to attend a summit with
Arab leaders to discuss a Saudi-drafted peace plan and called on
Arab nations to convene such a meeting.


At their summit in Riyadh last week, Arab leaders revived the
five-year-old plan that offers Israel normal relations if it
withdraws from all land seized in the 1967 Six Day War, and
allows for the creation of a Palestinian state and the return of
Palestinian refugees.


Israel rejected the plan when it was first adopted in 2002, but
has now said it could serve as a basis for talks provided there
were changes on the refugee issue, something the Arab heads of
state rejected in Riyadh.
