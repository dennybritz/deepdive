French Socialist presidential candidate Segolene Royal has
admitted that France's 35-hour working week has caused problems
in some sectors of the economy that need to be addressed.


"The 35-hour workweek was not a mistake," Royal said in an
interview with weekly magazine L'Express, to be published later
this week.


But "for a very long time we did not dare say that the 35-hour
workweek had not been well implemented everywhere," she said.


"To recognize that it needs to be assessed and that it has
created more problems in some sectors than solutions is a way of
giving ourselves room to act," she said.


The former Socialist government of Lionel Jospin adopted
legislation in 2000 which cut the number of hours worked during
the week from 39 to 35 as part of a plan to reduce unemployment,
back then hovering in the double digits.


It has been criticised for causing havoc in hospitals and
France's business lobby group, the MEDEF, maintains the shorter
workweek has slowed down productivity growth.


Royal said she would "remain loyal to principles but open to
discussion, even compromise, when it comes to the application" of
the 35-hour workweek.
