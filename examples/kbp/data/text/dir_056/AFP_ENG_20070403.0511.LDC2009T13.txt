The president and three other executives of bankrupt Spanish low-
cost airline Air Madrid, which suddenly halted its operations in
December leaving thousands of passengers stranded, were charged
with fraud on Tuesday, a judicial source said.


Jose Luis Carillo and the three others were ordered by a judge to
appear in court on April 13, the source said.


Spanish authorities suspect the four allowed the carrier, which
flew mainly between Spain and Latin America, to continue to sell
tickets even though they knew it would have to suspend its
activities.


Air Madrid grounded its planes on December 15 just hours before
Spain's transportation ministry was due to suspend its licence on
safety grounds following a probe into constant complaints from
passengers of huge delays.


The airline declared bankrupcy shortly after it ceased
operations. It carried 2.6 million passengers since its inaugural
flight in May 2004.


Carillo's right-hand man Julio Miguel Martinez Sola, sales
director Silvia Avelar Bravo and the defunct airline's director
of management, Juan Barjau Romero, were the other three Air
Madrid executives charged with fraud.
