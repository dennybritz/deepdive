The European aerospace giant EADS views its defence business as
an "anchor of stability" as its aircraft maker Airbus attempts to
steer itself out of its current crisis, the head of the group's
security and defence division said on Tuesday.


"We're developing into one the anchors of stability for EADS,"
division head Stefan Zoller told a news conference in Munich.


Last year, the security and defence division of the European
Aeronautics Defence and Space Company booked a 73-percent rise in
operating profit to 348 million euros (463 million dollars),
while Airbus turned in heavy losses as a result of the deep
crisis triggered by delays in its A380 super-jumbo jet programme.


While the division's earnings will be impacted by restructuring
costs this year, the division is expected to see operating profit
grow by 50 million euros annually from next year, Zoller said.


Sales are also projected to grow steadily after rising by 5.3
percent to 5.9 billion euros last year.


One of the division's biggest customers is the German army or
Bundeswehr.


And including sales from other military projects, EADS generated
total revenues of around 10 billion euros from its defence
activities last year, equivalent to around a quarter of total
sales.


The proportion is set to rise in future, Zoller said. In the
past, there had been talk of the division accounting for around
30 percent of group sales.
