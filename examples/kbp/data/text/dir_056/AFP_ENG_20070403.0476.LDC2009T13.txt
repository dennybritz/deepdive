The international Red Cross said on Tuesday it is launching a
preliminary emergency appeal for 819,000 dollars (615,000 euros)
to support aid efforts in the Solomon Islands after Monday's
tsunami.


The funds will be used to guarantee access to safe drinking
water, medical care and emergency shelter to affected
communities, as well as meet the long-term needs of survivors,
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies said in a statement.


"The situation is still very difficult ... the aftershocks
continued on Tuesday and in some places on Gizo Island, there is
not enough food and water," said Red Cross official Martin
Blackgrove.


The appeal comes on top of 53,000 dollars sent to the Solomon
Islands Red Cross from the organisation's Disaster Relief
Emergency Fund.


Solomon Islands officials said at least 24 people had been killed
and 5,400 made homeless, but warned that many others were missing
and the death toll would rise as the scale of the damage on the
west coast became clearer.


Police spokesman Mick Spinks said 13 coastal villages had been
nearly wiped out. "Virtually all the houses have been destroyed."
