Greece on Tuesday suspended the functioning of fan clubs for all
sports after a supporter died in a pitched battle ahead of a
women's volleyball match last week.


The 25-year-old fan was killed and five others were injured in an
arranged clash between some 300 hooligans of Greek arch-rivals
Olympiakos and Panathinaikos.


Sports minister Georges Orphanos made the announcement after
meeting on Tuesday with representatives from sporting groups
including football, basketball and volleyball.


The suspension will remain until new legislation is put in place
to increase security measures, including the creation of
electronic ticketing and the inclusion of video surveillance
cameras in stadia.


"The sporting family has decided to launch a battle against
violence and eliminate it," said Orphanos.


"You can rest assured that the government has the political
determination to achieve this and win the battle for the good of
society."


The Greek government last week decided to suspend all team sport
matches for two weeks as a result of the fan's death, an incident
casting doubt on measures taken against the violence that has
plagued sport in the country for decades.


So far a mix of tougher laws and closer cooperation with clubs
have not solved the problem.
