French club Lille will appeal the fine handed to them by European
football's governing body (UEFA) for incidents that marred their
Champions League last 16 encounter against Manchester United in
February.


Lille were fined 61,734 euros for security violations and
incorrect behaviour by the Lille players, who left the pitch
after Ryan Giggs's quickly-taken free kick took everyone by
surprise and consequently won the game.


"Lille football club have decided to appeal against the UEFA
ruling to protect their current and future interests," the club
said in a statement posted on their official website www.losc.fr.


United were fined 9,256 euros for incorrect behaviour by the
travelling fans including disturbances at the turnstyles.


Tear gas was used by police during the match at Len's Stade
Felix-Bollaert after ticketing problems led to 5,000 supporters
cramming into a stand built for 3,500.


Supporters appeared to be in danger of being crushed against a
10-foot high safety barrier and two fans were lifted over the
barrier while security officials slammed shut a gate which had
been pushed open by United supporters trying to relieve the
pressure.


Television images of the game were used by UEFA during the
investigation along with reports from both clubs and UEFA's
disciplinary committee.
