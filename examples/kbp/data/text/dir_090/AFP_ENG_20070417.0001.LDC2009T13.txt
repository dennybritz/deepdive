Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said Tuesday that it
will form a joint venture in India with engineering firm Larsen
and Toubro Ltd. to manufacture and sell boilers for coal-fired
power plants.


The joint venture will be set up this month with a capitalisation
of about 68 million dollars and is due to begin production of
supercritical pressure boilers by early 2009.


"The move is aimed at responding to a rapidly growing electricity
demand, in tandem with India's robust economic growth," the
Japanese industrial giant said in a statement.
