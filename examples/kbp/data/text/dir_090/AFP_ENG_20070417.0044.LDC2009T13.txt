Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels gunned down two people in Sri
Lanka's restive eastern region as violence continued during the
traditional New Year celebrations, the defence ministry said
Tuesday.


The two men were shot dead early Tuesday in Batticaloa district,
300 kilometers (190 miles) east of Colombo, the military said,
adding that investigations were underway.


The killings came after six other people were gunned down in the
same district over the weekend.


The military blamed the Tamil Tigers for the deaths, but the
rebels denied involvement.


Government forces are trying to eject Tamil Tiger rebels from
large swathes of jungle in the east. The rebels also run a mini-
state in the north of the island.


The majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamil community are
currently marking their common New Year festivities, which end on
Thursday.


More than 4,000 people were killed between December 2005 and the
first week of March 2007 across the island, including 675
civilians and 1,040 security personnel, according to defence
ministry figures.


The conflict has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972.
