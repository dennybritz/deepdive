Six-nation talks aimed at denuclearising North Korea could resume
within a day once a row over Pyongyang's frozen funds is fully
resolved, Japan's foreign minster said Tuesday.


North Korea has refused to shut down its Yongbyon reactor, as
agreed under a six-nation deal in February, until it receives 25
million dollars from a bank account in Macau.


"I wouldn't be surprised if the six-party talks started tomorrow
if the fund issue is resolved today as all the problems are about
financial technicalities," Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso
told reporters.


"But there is also a possibility that disputes between the United
States, China -- as Macau is in China -- and North Korea will
continue for a while, so I cannot tell you if the talks can
resume this month," he added.


The United States said it has found a way for North Korea to
access the money, which had been frozen because of allegations of
money laundering and counterfeiting.


North Korea, which tested an atom bomb last year, missed the
deadline Saturday to start shutting its reactor and to readmit UN
nuclear inspectors.


But South Korea's intelligence service said Tuesday that "unusual
movements" were seen at the Yongbyon site in what media reports
said could be a sign it was preparing to shut down the reactor.


The six-way talks involve China, Japan, the two Koreas, Russia
and the United States.
