China's urban fixed asset investment, a key driver for the
economy, rose 25.3 percent in the first three months of 2007, the
National Development and Reform Commission said Tuesday.


The figure compared with a 23.4 percent rise for the first two
months of the year, according to government figures published
earlier, suggesting that investment picked up somewhat during
March.


Fixed asset investment, a key indicator of state-funded spending
on major infrastructure and production capacity, is being fuelled
by huge amounts of liquidity in China's financial system.


It is widely believed that China's economy has picked up pace
again so far this year after a slight slowdown in the second half
of 2006.


China, which saw 10.7 percent growth in 2006 overall, is due to
publish key data for the first quarter in a briefing Thursday,
with many expecting the figures to show the economy once more
picking up steam.
