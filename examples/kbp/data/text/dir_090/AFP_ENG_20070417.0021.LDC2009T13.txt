South Sydney prop Roy Asotasi will captain a New Zealand rugby
league team including three new caps for the one-off Test against
Australia in Brisbane on Friday.


Asotasi replaces Ruben Wiki, who has retired from Test rugby
league, in a youthful side named Tuesday which is missing many
familiar faces through injury, retirement and unavailability.


Parramatta back Krisnan Inu, a surprise selection in the squad,
will start at fullback after just one appearance in the South
Sydney first team.


Two other 20-year-old new caps -- Brisbane utility Greg Eastwood
and New Zealand Warrior prop Sam Rapira -- will start the match
on the bench.


New Zealand (1 to 13) - Krisnan Inu (Parramatta), Jake Webster
(Gold Coast), Iosia Soliola (Sydney Roosters), Simon Mannering
(New Zealand Warriors), Manu Vatuvei (Warriors), Benji Marshall
(Tigers), Ben Roberts (Canterbury Bulldogs), Nathan Cayless
(Parramatta), Dene Halatau (Tigers), Roy Asotasi (captain - South
Sydney), Sonny Bill Williams (Bulldogs), Tony Puletua (Penrith),
David Fa'alogo (Souths).


Interchange: David Faiumu (North Queensland), Sam Rapira
(Warriors), Greg Eastwood (Brisbane), Frank Pritchard (Penrith).
