China on Tuesday expressed shock and offered condolences over the
shooting rampage that killed 33 at a US college, but said it
could not confirm reports that the shooter was a Chinese student.


"This is an extremely unfortunate incident. We are very shocked
by the shootings and we express our deep condolences to the
people of Virginia," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said
at a regular news briefing.


The incident at Virginia Tech University on Monday was the worst
shooting in US history.


Witnesses described the perpetrator as an "Asian-looking" man of
college age, according to media reports.


The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper reported that police had
identified the killer, who took his own life as well, as a 24
-year-old Chinese student who arrived in the United States last
August on a visa issued in Shanghai.


"As for whether the perpetrator was a Chinese student, we have
seen those reports but as far as we know, this matter is still
under investigation and we can't speculate on that," Liu said.


Liu said Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing sent a telegram to
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing "shock,
condolences and our sincere solicitude to the US government and
those affected by the shootings."
