China Southern Airlines turned around last year with a net profit
of 188 million yuan (24.3 million dollars), the nation's largest
carrier said Tuesday.


The company swung back to profit from a net loss of 1.8 billion
yuan in 2005, according to international accounting standards,
despite the impact of rising jet fuel prices and intense
competition as passenger traffic increased.


China Southern carried 49.2 million passengers in 2006, up 11.5
percent, and 851,580 tonnes of cargo, up 6.5 percent, it said in
its annual report filed with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.


The passenger load factor in 2006 was 71.7 percent, up 1.6
percentage points from a year earlier, while the overall load
factor -- a measure of how much capacity is being utilised -- was
up 0.5 percentage point at 63.8 percent.


The company did not provide any earnings forecast for 2007 but
noted that the rise in jet fuel prices is expected to ease over
the course of the year.


As of end-2006, the company's total assets stood at 76.2 billion
yuan under Chinese accounting standards, up 5.4 percent from 72.3
billion yuan at the end of 2005.
