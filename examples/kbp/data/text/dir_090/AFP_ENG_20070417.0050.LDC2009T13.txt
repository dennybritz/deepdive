After creating a furore in India by kissing a Bollywood starlet,
Richard Gere arrived in Kathmandu Tuesday to meet Tibetan
activists, an official from the International Campaign for Tibet
said.


"It's a low profile visit based around his concerns about Tibetan
refugees coming through Nepal," Kate Saunders, a spokeswoman for
the group, said.


With a long and porous border with Chinese-controlled Tibet to
the north, around 2,500 refugees a year make the dangerous trip
across the Himalayas into Nepal, and often onto India where the
spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, has lived in exile
since 1959.


Hollywood star Gere, 57, has been a supporter of the Tibetan
cause for 25 years and is "very much a hands-on chairman of the
International Campaign for Tibet," Saunders said.


Local media reported that Gere last visited Nepal in 1996, and
during this two- day visit he will meet leaders from the Tibetan
community and Nepali politicians, Saunders said.


Nepal's government recognises Beijing's "One China" policy, which
deems Taiwan and Tibet to be intrinsic parts of China.


On Monday protesters in India burned effigies of Gere after he
showered actress Shilpa Shetty with kisses at an AIDS awareness
event.
