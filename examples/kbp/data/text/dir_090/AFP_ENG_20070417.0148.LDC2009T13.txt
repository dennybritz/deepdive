At least 45 miners were trapped in two coal mining accidents in
central China, state press said Tuesday, again highlighting lax
safety standards in the world's most dangerous mining industry.


At least 33 miners were missing and feared dead after an
explosion ripped through the Wangzhuang coal mine in Henan
province late Monday, the State Administration of Work Safety
said.


After rescue operations began, another explosion shook the mine,
in the Pingdingshan mining region, hampering efforts to locate
the trapped miners, Xinhua news agency said.


Up to a dozen rescuers were injured in the second blast, it said.
Rescue work has continued.


Police were currently searching for the mine boss and five other
mine officials who were believed to have fled the scene, Xinhua
said.


In the second accident also on Monday, 12 miners were missing
after a flood in the privately-run Changcheng mine in Hunan
province, Xinhua said in a separate report.


Heavy rains in Hunan were currently hampering rescue efforts, the
report added.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
