The PlayStation 3's solid launch in Europe has helped the console
in the "perception wars" that affected its sales in Japan, Sony
chief executive Howard Stringer said in an interview published
Tuesday.


Sony's games unit was close to selling 800,000 units of the new
console in Europe where it was launched on March 22, Stringer was
quoted as saying by the London-based Financial Times newspaper.


"I think (in) the first two days in the UK, 100 million pounds
(199 million dollars) revenue changed hands and that's probably
the largest consumer electronics sale in history," he said.


Stringer said that the PlayStation 3 had hit the European market
"with more games and perhaps we lived up to the expectations in
Europe in a way that perhaps we didn't in Japan."


The electronics giant released the PlayStation 3 last year
initially only in key North American and Asian markets after a
delay of about six months due to a glitch with the DVD player.


Sony in January raised its net profit forecast for the year to
March 2007 to 110 billion yen (920 million dollars) from 80
billion yen due to the popularity of its flat-screen televisions,
digital cameras and the latest James Bond film.


The Japanese giant will release its annual results on May 16.
