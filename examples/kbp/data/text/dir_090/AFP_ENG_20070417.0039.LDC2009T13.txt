Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi called  Tuesday for Europe
and Japan to coordinate aid to Africa in the face of China's
increasingly visible presence in the continent.


"With regards to Africa, Europe and Japan should align in their
communication and become closer," Prodi told students at the
prestigious University of Tokyo.


"If we look at numbers, Europe and Japan together present a great
deal more aid to Africa than China," said Prodi, the former head
of the European Commission. "But when I talk to African leaders,
they only talk about China."


China has become a growing investor and donor to Africa, although
it has come under criticism in the West for supporting nations
such as Sudan despite the mass killings in the Darfur region.


Prodi called for European nations to step up coordination over
aid to Africa and also relations with Asia.


"I think it is very important to direct the European Union's
politics towards Asia. This is Asia's century ... and Asia's
revival will give support to the Mediterranean region," Prodi
said.


Prodi met Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and
agreed to put African development and global warming high on the
agenda in upcoming summits of the Group of Eight industrialised
nations.
