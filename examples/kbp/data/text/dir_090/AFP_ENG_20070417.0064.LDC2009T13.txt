Australian gaming giant Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd. said
Tuesday it was taking a 250 million US dollar stake in the
developer building a resort on the famous Las Vegas casino strip.


PBL said today that it would buy a 19.6 percent stake in
Fontainebleau Resorts, which owns a casino resort at Miami Beach
and is developing another in Las Vegas.


"This transaction provides PBL Gaming with a first-class entrance
into the US casino resort market, in particular, the renowned Las
Vegas strip," PBL executive chairman James Packer said.


Fontainebleau Las Vegas will include a casino, luxury hotel
rooms, suites, condominium-hotel units, restaurants, nightclubs,
a spa and meeting and convention facilities.


The resort will be developed on a 24.5-acre site comprised of the
former El Rancho Hotel and Algiers Hotel properties on the north
end of the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is expected
to open in late 2009.


Fontainebleau Resorts is also undertaking a complete renovation
of the 16-acre Fontainebleau Resort in Miami Beach, Florida,
which will re-open in 2008.


PBL is developing casinos in Macau in a joint venture with Hong
Kong's Melco International and last month set up an international
business development group to focus on overseas expansion.


It owns Crown Casino in Melbourne and Perth's Burswood Casino


PBL last year spun off its media assets into a new joint venture
to be half owned with private equity firm CVC Asia Pacific,
giving it a 3.7 billion US dollar war chest that Packer said at
the time would be used for international expansion.


PBL shares closed down 11 cents at 19.71 dollars in a lower
overall market.
