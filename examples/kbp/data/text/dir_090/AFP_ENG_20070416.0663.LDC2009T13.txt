China Merchants Bank, the mainland's sixth largest lender,
reported Tuesday a 81.22 percent increase in net profit for 2006
on the back of strong revenue growth from all businesses.


The bank reported a net profit of 6.79 billion yuan (871 million
US), up from 3.75 billion yuan and above forecast of 6.1 billion
yuan polled by Thomson Financial.


Core business revenue rose to 37.821 billion yuan from 28.738
billion a year earlier, while net interest income reached 21.51
billion yuan, up 29.25 percent over 2005.


Total assets of the bank stood at 934.10 billion yuan at the end
of last year, up from 734.613 billion at the end of 2005.


The bank further said its board has approved the establishment of
a finance leasing unit with a registered capital of 2 billion
yuan and a retirement pension management unit with a registered
capital of 200 million yuan.


In addition, the bank's board also authorized the management team
to invest in hybrid bonds issued by other commercial banks, with
the total investment not to exceed 5.0 percent of its investment
in outstanding bonds at the end of the previous year.
