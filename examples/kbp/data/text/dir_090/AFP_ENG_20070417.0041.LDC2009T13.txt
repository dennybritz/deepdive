At least 10 people were killed Tuesday and more than a dozen
injured when a van missed a sharp turn and plunged off the road
into a deep drainage ditch in northern India, police said.


"We have recovered 10 bodies so far. Rescue work is going on,"
police spokesman Salim Beigh told AFP in the Himalayan state of
Kashmir.


The accident took place in the Poonch district, 240 kilometres
(150 miles) from the state's winter capital Jammu.


The van fell into a 100-feet (30-metre) deep ditch, Beigh said.


Accidents are common in southern Kashmir as roads run through
rugged and steep mountains.
