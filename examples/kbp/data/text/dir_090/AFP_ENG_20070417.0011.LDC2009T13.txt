Australian newspaper publisher APN said Tuesday that a buyout
consortium had increased its offer for Australia's third largest
media group, valuing it at 2.9 billion dollars (2.4 billion US).


APN News and Media Ltd, which publishes more than 120 newspapers
in Australia and New Zealand, said the buyout consortium had
lifted its offer from 6.10 dollars a share to 6.20.


APN said the consortium comprising Ireland's Independent News,
Providence Equity Partners and The Carlyle Group had also advised
that the offer was final, meaning it cannot be increased.


Ted Harris, the head of an independent committee on the APN board
examining the offer, said it represented an attractive premium
over historical trading prices for APN shares.


"The independent committee recommends that all shareholders vote
in favour of the scheme," Harris said.


He said the independent committee believed APN's share price
would fall if the bid lapsed and no alternative proposal emerged.


Independent News already owns 42 percent of APN. Its consortium
offered 6.10 dollars a share in February for the outstanding
stock.


APN shares were up 11 cents or 1.9 percent at 6.03 dollars in
mid-afternoon trading on a falling overall market.
