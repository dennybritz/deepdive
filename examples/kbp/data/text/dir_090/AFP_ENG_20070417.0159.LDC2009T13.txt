Veteran Italian striker Christian Vieri is set to end a year on
the sidelines by playing for Atalanta against Empoli in a league
match on Wednesday, the Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Tuesday.


The 33-year-old goalscorer last played on March 26 of last year
when he injured his left knee when turning out for Monaco against
Paris St Germain in the French first division.


He underwent two operations since then to repair the damage and
eventually signed on August 30 for Atalanta for the minimum
salary allowed under Italian labour laws.


Vieri played 49 times for the Italian national side, scoring 23
goals, but was overlooked for the squad that eventually won the
World Cup in Germany last year.


He moved to Monaco in January of 2006, but played only seven
games for them before injuring his knee.
