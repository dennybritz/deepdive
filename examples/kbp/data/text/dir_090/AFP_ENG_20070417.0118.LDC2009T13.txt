The China Tour returns to action in May with the number of events
increased to eight and its players buoyed by the global success
of Liang Wen-chong.


The curtain will be raised on the Tour's third season at the
Sofitel Golf Championship in Nanjing on May 10 and end in October
with the Omega Championships in Beijing.


The tournaments will offer 100,000 US dollars in prize money as
the mainland's emerging generation of professional golfers are
encouraged to develop their games.


The Tour, which had just four events when launched in 2005, will
traverse China, stopping Qingdao, Guangzhou, Yanji, Shanghai,
Kunming and Xiamen, as well as Nanjing and Beijing.


The circuit's star player Liang gave the Tour a much needed boost
when he won the Singapore Masters in March -- an event joint-
sanctioned by the Asian and European Tours -- and donated his
winnings to developing golf in China.


Liang is expected to compete again this year along with Chinese
trailblazer Zhang Lian-wei.
