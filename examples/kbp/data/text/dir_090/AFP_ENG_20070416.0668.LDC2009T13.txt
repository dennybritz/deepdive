China's urban fixed asset investment, a key driver for the
economy, picked up speed in March, the government said Tuesday as
an influential state newspaper warned about signs of overheating.


Fixed asset investment in urban areas rose 25.3 percent in the
first three months of 2007, the National Development and Reform
Commission said in a statement on its website.


That compared with a 23.4 percent rise for the first two months
of the year, according to government figures published earlier,
suggesting that investment picked up during March. For 2006, the
figure was 24 percent.


Fixed asset investment, a key indicator of state-funded spending
on major infrastructure and production capacity, is being fuelled
by huge amounts of liquidity in China's financial system.


It is widely believed that China's economy has picked up pace
again so far this year after a slight slowdown in the second half
of 2006.


China, which saw 10.7 percent growth in 2006 overall, is due to
publish key data for the first quarter in a briefing Thursday,
with many expecting the figures to show the economy once more
picking up steam.


The data will point to overheating in the country's economy, the
official Nanfang Daily reported, citing Geng Qinzeng, an official
with the National Bureau of Statistics.


"We have completed the first quarter economic statistics," Geng
told the newspaper.


"The people who have studied the figures think that risks of
overheating are emerging and that the overheating could be as
serious as last year," he added.
