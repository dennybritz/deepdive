Japanese share prices were mixed in morning trade on Tuesday with
the main Nikkei index up 0.24 percent after Wall Street's strong
performance overnight, dealers said.


But they said that optimism was tempered by caution ahead of
upcoming company earning results in the United States and Japan.


The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index of leading shares
rose 41.48 points to 17,669.78 but the broader Nikkei-225 index
of all first-section shares slipped 1.19 points or 0.07 percent
to 1,724.41.
