Bangladesh's last prime minister Khaleda Zia has agreed to be
exiled in a deal with the military-backed government in return
for leniency for her sons, who are accused of corruption, an aide
told AFP Tuesday.


"Zia has agreed to leave the country but she is taking her time,"
said the aide, who was speaking on condition he was not
identified.


His comments confirmed widespread reports in the Bangladeshi
press, citing government officials, that Zia was being forced out
as part of a major drive against rampant political corruption.


She has been under virtual house arrest since last week.


"The army held several round of negotiations with her. The
release of Arafat Rahman and halting of the case against Tareque
Rahman were part of that process," the aide told AFP, referring
to Zia's sons.


The source gave no further details, although major dailies said
she would be leaving for Saudi Arabia in the coming days.


Bangladesh's interim government took power in January after
President Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency and
cancelled planned elections following months of political
violence.


Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party has been at the heart of the
political turmoil with the opposition Awami League led by her
arch rival Sheikh Hasina Wajed, also a former premier.


Hasina, 60, is currently on holiday in the United States and has
already been charged in absentia with extortion and the murder of
four political activists last October.


Authorities say she faces arrest if she dares return home.
