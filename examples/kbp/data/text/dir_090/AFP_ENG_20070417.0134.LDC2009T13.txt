British 12-month inflation hit 3.1 percent in March, the highest
level since 1997, breaching the Bank of England's government-set
ceiling of 3.0 percent, official data showed on Tuesday.


The figure compared with 2.8 percent in February. The central
bank is charged by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour government
with keeping 12-month inflation within a 1.0 percent band either
side of 2.0 percent.
