Iran on Tuesday sent its condolences to the people of arch enemy
the United States after 33 people were killed in a shooting at a
university in the US state of Virginia.


"Iran regrets and condemns this act and presents its condolences
to the (American) people and the families of the victims,"
foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said in a
statement.


Such an act "is against divine and humanitarian values," he
added.


The United States cut ties with Iran in 1980 after the seizure of
the American embassy in Tehran by Islamic revolutionary radicals
and ties have remained frozen ever since.
