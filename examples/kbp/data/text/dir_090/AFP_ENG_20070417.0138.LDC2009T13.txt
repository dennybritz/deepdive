Gunmen killed at least six people, including a senior policeman,
in a series of attacks in Iraq on Tuesday, security officials
said.


A police brigadier general and his two bodyguards were shot dead
when gunmen attacked them near his residence in the Al-Thawra
district of Mosul, the northern city. The high-ranking official
was not immediately identified.


The attack occurred despite a security crackdown in Mosul
launched by Iraqi and US security forces early this month to rein
in growing insurgent violence in Iraq's third largest city.


A leader from the Jubur tribe was shot dead by gunmen west of the
northern oil city of Kirkuk on Tuesday, police Captain Mahmud
Atta said.


In another attack, gunmen killed a professor at the Islamic
Sciences University of Baghdad, Mohammed Ali Hamza, in the
Saydiyah district in the southwestern part of the Iraqi capital,
a security official said.


Attacks against Iraqi academics have steadily increased in the
past year as insurgents strike at this largely vulnerable
community.


South of Baghdad, gunmen killed a barber outside his shop, a
security official said. Iraqi barbers are often targeted by
extremists who believe the shaving of beards is un-Islamic.
