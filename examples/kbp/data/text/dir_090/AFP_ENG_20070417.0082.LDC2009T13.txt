An Israeli man was wounded on Tuesday by Palestinian gunfire in
the occupied West Bank, the army said.


"An Israeli was wounded this morning by Palestinian gunfire near
the Maale settlement west of Ramallah," a military spokesman
said, without giving details.


Israeli public radio said two other Israelis were lightly wounded
as gunmen shot at their car at a rest stop near the Jewish
settlement.
