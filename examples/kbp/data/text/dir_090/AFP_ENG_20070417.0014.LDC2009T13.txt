Chinese share prices lost 0.58 percent in Tuesday morning trade
amid profit- taking, with bank stocks and telecom issues losing
ground, dealers said.


They said investors were cashing out over the concerns that
corrections would begin after the consecutive sharp gains.


"The market saw some profit-taking after the Shanghai Composite
index breached 3,600 points, with stocks that have seen
significant gains in recent sessions, such as financial stocks,
weighed down," Cao Yan, an analyst at Soochow Securities, said.


"In the short run, the market could see some corrections after
rising so sharply in recent trading weeks, and it might be wise
to lock in gains for the moment," Cao added.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, ended the morning
down 21.03 points at 3,575.42, after touching a new all-time high
of 3,622.89.


The Shanghai A-share Index was down 22.64 points or 0.60 percent
at 3,757.96 and the Shenzhen A-share Index was down 0.83 points
or 0.08 percent at 1,019.15.
