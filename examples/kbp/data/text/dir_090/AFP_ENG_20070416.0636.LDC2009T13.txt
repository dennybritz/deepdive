A cargo vessel went aground off northeastern Japan in the Pacific
early Tuesday but all 17 Russian crew members were safely
rescued, Japan's coast guard said.


The 4,643-tonne Jane flying the flag of St Vincent ran aground
overnight off Souma on the northeast coast of Japan's main island
of Honshu, the coast guard said in a statement.


Three patrol boats and a helicopter were dispatched after the
coast guard got an emergency signal from the ship, which was
carrying 5,248 tonnes of coal from Sakhalin in Russia's far east.


"We have rescued all the Russian crew safely and we have not
received any reports of injuries," coast guard spokesman Hiroshi
Miura said.


"Although we need to investigate into the accident, rough weather
should be taken into consideration," he said.


The Japanese meteorological agency issued a warning of strong
wind and high waves in the region when the accident occurred.
