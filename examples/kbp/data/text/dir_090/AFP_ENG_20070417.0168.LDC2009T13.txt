Hong Kong share prices closed firmer Tuesday after a see-saw
trading session as gains in heavyweights HSBC and China Mobile
offset profit-taking pressure after Monday's strong gains,
dealers said.


They said trading was cautious ahead of key economic data in the
US, including March consumer inflation and new residential
construction figures.


The Hang Seng Index closed up 31.08 points or 0.15 percent at
20,788.61, off a low of 20,635.63 and a high of 20,816.11.
Turnover was 63.21 billion Hong Kong dollars (8.1 billion US).
