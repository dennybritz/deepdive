added 34 here Monday, leading the Houston Rockets to a 120-117
National Basketball Association victory over the Phoenix Suns.


McGrady, who made 14-of-31 shots form the field, grabbed a game-
high 11 rebounds and passed out a team-best nine assists while
Yao, who grabbed nine rebounds, made 14 of 20 shots from the
field and all six of his free throws.


The Rockets improved to 52-29, the fourth-best record in the
league and the Western Conference, while the Suns slipped to
61-20, still the second-best mark in the league.


Phoenix will have the second seed in the West playoffs by virtue
of winning the Pacific Division title, trailing only Southwest
division winner Dallas, which has the NBA's best record at 66-14.

in the playoffs behind Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio and Northwest
division champion Utah despite winning more games than the Jazz.

added 27 for Phoenix and Canadian guard Steve Nash scored 15
points and added 15 assists in a losing cause.
