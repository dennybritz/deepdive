Hong Kong gold prices opened higher Tuesday at 689.40-689.90 US
dollars an ounce, up from Monday's close of 687.20-687.70
dollars.


Overnight in London, gold reached its highest level since May 18,
2006 at 690.35 dollars, supported by current dollar weakness and
continued strength in the oil market, dealers said.


Gold is priced in dollars which means that a fall in the value of
the US unit makes the precious metal cheaper to buy for investors
using other currencies.


The dollar has weakened against the major currencies in recent
weeks on concerns over flagging US growth, which were heightened
on Friday by a fall in the latest University of Michigan consumer
confidence survey.


The index slumped to an eight-month low of 85.3 index points in
April from 88.4 in March, raising fears that US consumer spending
levels are likely to fall as confidence is knocked back by a
faltering housing market.


The precious metal was also underpinned by continued strength in
the price of oil, which has risen on ongoing concerns over
dwindling US gasoline (petrol) stocks and as violence ahead of
the Nigerian elections raised fears over supply disruptions.


The metal benefits overall from positive sentiment towards the
commodities sector sparked by rising oil prices and is seen as a
hedge against inflation.
