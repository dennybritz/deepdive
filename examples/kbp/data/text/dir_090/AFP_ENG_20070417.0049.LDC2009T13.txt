At least 13 people were killed Tuesday and 28 injured when a van
missed a sharp turn and plunged off the road into a deep drainage
ditch in northern India, police said.


"We have pulled out 13 bodies. The injured have been taken to
hospital," police spokesman Salim Beigh told AFP in the Himalayan
state of Kashmir.


The accident took place in the Poonch district, 240 kilometres
(150 miles) from the state's winter capital Jammu.


The van fell into a 100-foot (30-metre) deep ditch, Beigh said.


Accidents are common in southern Kashmir as roads run through
rugged and steep mountains.
