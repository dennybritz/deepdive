Workers at Skoda Auto, the Czech Republic's biggest car maker,
went on strike on Tuesday as part of a campaign for better pay
and conditions, the Czech press agency CTK reported.


The unions said that no car would leave the factory, where daily
production is around 2,500 vehicles, Czech media reports said.


Talks on Monday failed to break the deadlock over a management
offer of 10-percent base salary increases and other bonuses
amounting to a rise of 13 percent over the period of April 2007
to April 2009.


Unions rejected this offer last week. After they announced their
intention to strike, management reduced the proposed 10-percent
raises to 7.5 percent.


Josef Stredula, head of Kovo, the main union at Skoda, said the
two sides would meet again on Wednesday.


Skoda management stoked union anger by threatening to move car
engine production currently carried out in the Czech Republic to
Volkswagen's Wolfsburg, Germany, headquarters, Stredula said on
Monday.


Based in Mlada Boleslav, about 55 kilometres (35 miles) northeast
of Prague, Skoda Auto employs some 26,000 people. Kovo says
around 18,000 are its members.


The company earned record net profits of 11.06 billion koruna
(392 million euros, 530 million dollars) last year, an increase
of 40 percent over the previous year.


It is the Czech Republic's largest exporter, responsible for 7.7
percent of total sales abroad last year.
