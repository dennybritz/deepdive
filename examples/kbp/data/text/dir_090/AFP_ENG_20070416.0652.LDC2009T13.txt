At least 33 miners were trapped and feared dead in a coal mine in
central China after a series of explosions ripped through the
site, the government and press reports said Tuesday.


The first explosion occurred Monday night at the Wangzhuang Coal
Mine in Pingdingshan, a major coal mining region of Henan
province, the State Administration of Work Safety said.


According to Xinhua news agency, after rescue operations began,
another explosion shook the mine, hampering efforts to save the
trapped miners.


Up to a dozen rescuers were injured in the second blast, it said.
Rescue work has continued.


China's coal mines are regarded as the most dangerous in the
world, with 4,746 workers dying in 2,845 accidents last year,
according to official figures.


Independent labour groups put the death toll at as many as 20,000
miners annually, as mine operators often cover up accidents to
avoid costly shutdowns and fines.
