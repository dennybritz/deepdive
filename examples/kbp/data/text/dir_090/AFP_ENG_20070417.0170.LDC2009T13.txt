Halloren, the oldest chocolate factory in Germany, hopes to
attract investors with a sweet tooth by going public this year,
company chairman Klaus Lelle said on Tuesday.


"We have decided to pursue the strategic option of a stock market
listing. As things stand, we will probably go public by the end
of the first half of this year," Lelle said.


The 200-year-old company already turned itself into an AG
(Aktiengesellschaft or joint stock company) at the end of 2006 as
a first step towards a flotation.


Set up in Halle an der Saale in 1804, Halloren is best known for
its "Kugeln" or chocolate-coated balls of milk and cocoa cream,
which account for the largest part of overall group sales of
25.86 million euros (35 million dollars).


The group booked net profit of 1.03 million euros last year.


Over the past 10 years, growth has trebled. And Halloren began
building a new production site in Halle in October.


The company employs a workforce of 330.
