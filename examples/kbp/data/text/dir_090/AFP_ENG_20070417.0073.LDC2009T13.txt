The French state-run mail group La Poste plans to order 10,000
electric delivery vehicles in the next five years as part of a
strategy to promote the battery-run car in France, the government
announced Tuesday.


This week, La Poste is to invite manufacturers to submit bids to
supply the first 500 vehicles for delivery in 2008.


"There has never been such a big order (for electric vehicles) in
the world," said French Industry Minister Francois Loos in an
interview with AFP, referring to the plans for 10,000 electric
vehicles.


"This large-scale experiment will really launch the electric car
in France, in a visible way for everyone, and will enable us to
define the economic and technical conditions" needed for its
deployment, he said.


The French post office has been testing eight electric vehicles
in Paris and the city of Bordeaux since 2005 made by French group
SVA, which is owned by defence group Dassault and specialist
vehicle manufacturer Heulioz.


SVE and French transportation group Bollore as well as car
manufacturers are expected to respond to the invitation to supply
the vehicles.


La Poste already owns 60,000 vehicles, 30,000 push bikes, 25
aircraft and three trains.
