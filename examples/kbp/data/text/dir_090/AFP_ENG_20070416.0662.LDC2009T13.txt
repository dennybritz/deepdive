Millions of South Koreans can get access to the Encyclopedia
Britannica through their mobile phones from Tuesday, the leading
operator here said.


SK Telecom said its 20 million-odd subscribers were now able to
consult the prestigious encyclopedia on their cellphones.


"If you punch in your query in either Korean or English, you will
get the results in both image files and texts," said an SK
Telecom spokesman.


He said the new service, which costs users typically around
100-150 won (11-16 cents) a minute, is part of the company's
efforts to tap the promising cellphone-based search market.


Cellphone-based search is emerging as a key application of the
wireless Internet, he noted.


SK Telecom last September tied up with Google, the world's
largest search engine, to develop a next-generation search engine
specifically for cellphones.
