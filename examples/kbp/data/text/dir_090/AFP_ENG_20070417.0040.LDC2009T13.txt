A new anti-HIV drug developed by Chinese scientists has been
licensed for clinical testing, state media reported Tuesday.


Nifeviroc, which works by inhibiting CCR5, a protein that
commonly exists on the surface of human immune cells, is set to
become China's first entry-inhibitor for HIV treatment, the China
Daily said.


"The CCR5 protein provides a medium through which the HIV virus
can infect healthy cells," said Ma Dawei, a researcher with the
Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry involved in the drug's
development, according to the report.


"By deactivating the protein, the virus can be stopped before it
enters the cell," Ma said.


The report said early tests have indicated that Nifeviroc, which
is taken orally, has promising anti-virus capabilities and few
side effects. Therefore, hopes are high that it can provide an
effective barrier against the HIV virus.


But scientists said it will be a further three to five years
before the drug is ready to be put into clinical use.


An American company is currently involved in the third-phase
clinical testing of a drug with a similar mechanism to Nifeviroc
and which is expected to become the world's first oral HIV entry-
inhibitor, the report added.
