More than half of all Lithuanians want the Baltic state to recall
its troops from Iraq, according to a poll published on Tuesday.


The survey showed 56.3 percent of Lithuanians support the
withdrawal of troops from Iraq, while 31.2 percent said the
Baltic state's soldiers should stay in the country.


Some 12.5 percent were undecided, the survey which was carried
out last month by Spinter Tyrimai and published on the Delfi
Internet portal, showed.


Nearly half -- 49.5 percent -- of the 1,003 respondents to the
poll were against Lithuanian troops taking part in any
international missions, while 40.2 percent felt Lithuanian troops
should continue to take part in global military missions.


Around one percent of Lithuania's armed forces, which numbers
around 18,000 troops, are currently serving in international
military missions.


About 60 Lithuanian soldiers are in Iraq, and another 120 in
Afghanistan, where the Baltic nation leads a NATO provincial
reconstruction team in Ghor province.


Some 30 Lithuanian soldiers are also serving in Kosovo, with a
handful of others on international missions in Georgia, Macedonia
and Croatia.
