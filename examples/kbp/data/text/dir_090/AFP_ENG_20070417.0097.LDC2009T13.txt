Chinese share prices shrugged off early weakness and closed 0.43
percent higher Tuesday at another record on strong fund inflows
with property and metal stocks gaining ground, dealers said.


They said the market was boosted by continued capital inflows
despite some concerns that corrections would be needed after
consecutive sharp gains.


Turnover jumped to record high of 176.11 billion yuan (22.78
billion US dollars) as about 90 companies rose by their daily
limits of 10 percent.


The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and
B-shares, closed up 15.43 points at a record 3,611.87.


The Shanghai A-share Index was up 15.76 points or 0.42 percent at
3,796.37 on turnover of 174.96 billion yuan and the Shenzhen
A-share Index was up 17.01 points or 1.67 percent at a record
1,036.99, on turnover of 98.77 billion yuan.
