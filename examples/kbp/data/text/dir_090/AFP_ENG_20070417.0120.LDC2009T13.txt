Iran on Tuesday denied it was holding a former FBI agent said by
the United States to have disappeared on the southern island of
Kish, saying it had no information on his whereabouts.


"They (the United States) claim that someone entered Kish.
Iranian and US officials are investigating and following up this
issue," government spokesman Gholam Hossein Elham told reporters.


"Both sides are trying to obtain additional information. There
was no arrest," he said.


The United States has pressed Iran a third time for information
about the mysterious disappearance more than a month ago of
former FBI agent Robert Levinson, officials in Washington said on
Monday.
