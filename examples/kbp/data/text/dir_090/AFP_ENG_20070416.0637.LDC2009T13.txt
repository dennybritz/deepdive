A strained left hamstring forced Chicago Cubs centerfielder
Alfonso Soriano out of the team's Major League Baseball game
against San Diego here Monday in the top of the fifth inning.


Soriano, signed to the richest free agent deal in club history
before the season, was limping after attempting to make a diving
catch on a pop fly.


The 31-year-old Dominican standout dove for the ball and slipped
when he tried to make a throw to the infield.


Soriano signed a seven-year deal worth 136 million dolllars after
playing in left field for the Washington Nationals last season.


Soriano has had a slow start in the first two weeks of the
season, hitting only .245 with no home runs and only one stolen
base. Last season he smacked 46 homers and stole 41 bases.
