Hundreds of Chinese, Korean and Japanese nationals are believed
to be students at the university in Virginia where 33 people died
in a gun rampage, including one who was injured, reports said
Tuesday.


There are around 460 Korean students studying at Virginia Tech
and an estimated 500 students of Korean descent, South Korea's
Yonhap news agency reported.


The agency said a South Korean studying civil engineering, Park
Chang-Min, was hospitalised after catching a bullet in the arm
during the still unexplained shooting spree.


It quoted the head of the university's Korean student
association, named as Lee Seung-woo, saying the bullet
"penetrated the arm and scraped the side of the body but did not
damage any bones."


Park was expected to be released soon, it said.


Between 400 and 500 Chinese students are also at the university,
China's Xinhua news agency said.


It cited a board member of Virginia Tech's Association of Chinese
Students and Scholars saying that no Chinese were believed to be
among the victims.


Japan meanwhile said all 21 Japanese nationals studying at the
university were confirmed to be safe.


"More than 30 people died in this very tragic incident. I would
like to express condolences from the bottom of my heart," chief
Japanese government spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki said.
