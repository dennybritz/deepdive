Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki was expected in
Ankara Tuesday for an impromptu meeting with his Turkish
counterpart Abdullah Gul, the Anatolia news agency reported.


Mottaki had called for the meeting late Monday, Anatolia said,
but gave no details as to the subjects on the agenda.


Turkey, a predominantly Muslim but officially secular country,
has expressed a desire to mediate in relations between its
neighbour Iran and the international community on the issue of
Tehran's controversial nuclear programme.
