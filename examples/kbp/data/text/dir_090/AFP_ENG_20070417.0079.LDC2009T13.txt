German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom proposed on
Tuesday to cut wages of the 50,000 employees in its services
division by 12 percent over the next two and a half years in
return for job guarantees until the end of 2010.


In the current tug-of-war with the giant services sector union
Ver.di over the planned shake-up of its services activities,
Deutsche Telekom said it a statement that the salaries of the
employees affected should be cut by 12 percent over a period of
30 months.


Deutsche Telekom is planning to transfer 50,000 staff into a
legally separate services company, called T-Service, at lower pay
and longer hours.


But Ver.di is demanding job protection measures for those
employees affected and has staged a number of temporary walk-outs
this week and last week in protest at the plans.
