Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahd Al-
Sabah has slammed the door on any hope Australia had of competing
in the Asian Games, saying it would not be fair to Oceania.


The Sheikh acknowledged the benefits Australia's inclusion would
bring, but said they were outweighed by the damage it would do to
Oceania's other sporting nations.


"Let me be honest, Australia will add value for money, 100
percent," he told AFP Tuesday on the sidelines of the OCA annual
congress.


"Everyone knows they have a very high standard of sport and
organisation.


"But while Australia will add value to our technical side, to our
sporting side, to our sponsors, to our Games, what about the
other National Olympic Committees in Oceania?


"We will benefit but they will lose.


"I believe that globally in sporting terms there should be China
and Asia, Australia and Oceania, United States and North America,
and Africa.


"We have to be fair to our colleagues in Oceania."


The OCA, a grouping of 45 Asian Olympic committees, oversees the
Asian Games, which last year had athletes from 45 countries
competing in 39 sports -- the biggest Asiad ever.


Australian Olympic Committee secretary general Craig Phillips was
quoted as saying in December that some of the AOC's member sports
were keen for tougher competition outside Oceania.


"Some are very keen for more top-level competition in Asia,
others are not so keen because of links with Oceania," he said.


"The AOC believes we can improve in sports like gymnastics, judo,
wrestling and taekwondo by competing against the best in Asia."


Last year, Football Federation Australia dumped Oceania to join
the Asian Football Confederation, which has allowed it to compete
in the Asian Cup finals this year.
