Authorities in Indian Kashmir have sacked nearly 140 state
employees in the past two years following investigations that
found they were linked to Muslim rebels, an official said
Tuesday.


The state official, who asked not to be named, said most of those
sacked were working with the police.


"Many more" people were under scrutiny, he added.


"Their services were terminated after inquiries revealed their
active links to militants," he said, describing them as
"subversive elements working from within".


"They are more dangerous than militants," he said.


Kashmir is in the grip of a 17-year-old insurgency against Indian
rule that has left more than 42,000 people dead by official
count. Human rights activists put the death toll at 70,000,
including 10,000 people who have disappeared over the years and
are presumed dead.


India and Pakistan, which hold the region in part but claim it in
full, began a peace process in January 2004 which has led to a
marginal decrease in militant violence.


The daily killings have come down from 10 per day in 2001 to
three in 2006.
