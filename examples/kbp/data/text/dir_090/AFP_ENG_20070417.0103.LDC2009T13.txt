Chinese demand for an endangered tropical hardwood tree used to
make luxury flooring is driving it to extinction, Greenpeace said
Tuesday.


China imported about 60,000 cubic metres (2.1 million cubic feet)
of merbau logs in 2006, most of it smuggled from Papua New Guinea
and Indonesia, the environmental group said in a report.


The wood was used mostly to produce high-end hardwood flooring
for the domestic market and exports to the US, Canada, Japan,
Australia and Europe, it said.


"This is a highly prized species for luxury goods and the market
demand in China as well as in Europe, North America and Asia
Pacific is driving merbau to extinction," said Tamara Stark, a
forest expert with Greenpeace.


Unprecedented economic growth, coupled with a shortage of
domestic forest resources, had seen China become the world's
largest importer of tropical logs including merbau, the report
said.


China also had the world's second-largest wood manufacturing
sector after the US, it said.


The Greenpeace investigation showed Chinese importers used
sophisticated methods such as forging import documents as prices
of merbau soared to more than 600 dollars per cubic metre.
