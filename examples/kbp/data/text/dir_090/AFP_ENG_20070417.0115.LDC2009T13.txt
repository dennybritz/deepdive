South Korea's leading party Tuesday strongly criticised President
Roh Moo-Hyun over plans to build a two-million-dollar memorial
hall, saying part of the cost would come from public funds.


Roh's office said Monday it was in talks with a private
university in the president's southeastern home town of Gimhae on
the construction of a hall to be dedicated to the president.


Roh will stand down in February next year after five years in
office. The constitution bars presidents from seeking a second
term.


The university estimated the total cost at two billion won (2.1
million dollars) which local media said would be partly funded by
the government.


"It is ridiculous to build a memorial hall for Roh Moo-Hyun,"
said Na Kyung-Won, spokeswoman for the Grand National Party (GNP)
which is the largest in parliament.


"Why doesn't he let people build his memorial hall after he makes
great achievements for people?"


She added that the GNP "will not approve even a single won in
budget for the presidential memorial hall".


A presidential spokesman said no decisions had been made on how
to finance the hall.


Roh's popularity rating plunged to 11 percent in late 2006 amid a
slowing economy and prickly South Korea-US ties. But they have
recovered to around 30 percent after he pushed through a major
free trade pact with the United States.


South Korea has no memorial hall dedicated to any president.
