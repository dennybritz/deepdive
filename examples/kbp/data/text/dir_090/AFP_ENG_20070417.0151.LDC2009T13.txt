Advertisements on mobile telephones in Japan are set to triple by
2011, outpacing growth of advertising on the Internet, according
to a study.


Spending on such advertisements is expected to hit 128.4 billion
yen (1.1 billion dollars) in 2011, compared with 39 billion last
year, Japan's leading advertising firm Dentsu said.


By comparision, Japan's market for non-mobile Internet
advertisements is expected to grow from 231 billion yen to 400
billion yen in the same period, according to the study released
Monday.


The growth comes after Japanese telecom operators last year
equipped phones to search online by keyword, allowing advertisers
to post related links in a revenue-generating model pioneered by
Internet giant Google.


Japan has more than 100 million mobile subscribers out of a
population of 127.7 million people.


It is also one of the most advanced markets, with more than two-
thirds of mobile subscribers using third-generation or even more
sophisticated sets that allow surfing of the Internet and other
advanced functions.
