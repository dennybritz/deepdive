Guyana's President Bharrat Jagdeo and First Lady Varshnie Jagdeo
on Monday announced that they would be divorcing after eight
years of marriage.


"We wish to inform the people of Guyana that we have decided to
end our marriage as we have grown apart over the years," said the
president, who is a Russian- trained economist.


The South American nation's first couple have been rarely seen in
public together since they married in July 1998 under Hindu
rites, sparking off widespread speculation for months that they
were not on good terms.


At his inauguration following last August's general elections,
Jagdeo, 43, did not pay tribute to his wife, instead commending
his several sisters for their support.


"It is in amicable parting and we feel that this is the best
course for us as we both wish to find happiness and have families
of our own in the future," the Guyanese leader added. The couple
does not have any children.


Jagdeo urged Guyanese to "understand and respect our decision" in
what both he and the First Lady called a "private matter."


Varshnie Jagdeo said she would be continuing her charitable work
for children, efforts that are being supported by the president.
