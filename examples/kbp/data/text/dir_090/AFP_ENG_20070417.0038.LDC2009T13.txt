Malaysia has asked civil servants with more than one wife to
declare their marriages to prevent disputes over pensions if they
die, a report said Tuesday.


A spokeswoman for Malaysia's Public Service Department (PSD) said
there had been cases of "long-standing conflicts" among widows
over the rights to their husbands' pension payments.


"They are encouraged to make the declaration to their respective
heads of department," the New Straits Times quoted Hasniah Rashid
as saying.


"If anything happens to them, we know who to get in touch with
and the right amount of pension to be paid to the wives," she
said.


Muslim men in Malaysia are allowed up to four wives. Activists
and women's groups say polygamy is cruel and has deviated from
its original purpose in Islam, which was to protect widows and
orphans.


Hasniah said the department had been forced to revise pension
payments to spouses after the sudden appearance of a second or
third wife also demanding their husband's pension.


Malaysia's civil service union, Cuepacs, welcomed the call,
saying it was a waste of the PSD's time to sort out payment
revisions.


"If they want to marry again and again, but they don't pose any
problem to the PSD or civil service, then it should be okay," the
paper quoted Cuepacs president Omar Osman as saying.


"But the problem is those who take another wife and create a lot
of problems for others," he said.
