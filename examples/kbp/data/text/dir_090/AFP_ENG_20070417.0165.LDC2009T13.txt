The Israeli army on Tuesday killed a Palestinian militant near
the West Bank city of Jenin, security sources said.


The victim, Ashraf Hanaisha, 22, was a member of Al-Aqsa
Brigades, a militant group loosely affiliated with president
Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party, they said.


No immediate details or confirmation from the Israeli army were
available.


Hanaisha's death brought to 5,660 the number of people killed
since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000,
the vast majority of them Palestinians, according to an AFP
count.
