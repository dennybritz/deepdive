An 80-year-old Chinese woman sentenced to death for drug
trafficking said she had needed the money from the trade to buy
herself a decent burial plot, state media reported Tuesday.


Zhang Shouzhen's death sentence came with a two-year reprieve,
meaning it will likely be commuted to life in prison if she
behaves well for the next 24 months.


She was convicted by a court in southern China's Guizhou province
for trying to transport eight kilogrammes (17.6 pounds) of opium
last year, Xinhua news agency reported.


Zhang said she was hoping to use the 10,000-yuan (1,290-dollar)
payment for transporting the drugs from her Guizhou home to
Beijing to buy herself a burial plot.


"I wanted the money to buy a good plot of land in a cemetery,"
Xinhua quoted her as saying.


Her daughter and her daughter's former husband were jailed for 15
years and 12 years respectively for their role, although both
denied any knowledge of the illegal trafficking, the report said.
