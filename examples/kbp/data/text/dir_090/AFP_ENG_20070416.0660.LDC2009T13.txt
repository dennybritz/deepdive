The governor of Virginia on Tuesday cut short a trade mission to
Asia to return home after a shooting rampage left 33 people dead
at a university in his state.


Governor Timothy Kaine had just landed Monday in Tokyo for the
two-week tour to negotiate business deals in Japan, Hong Kong and
India.


"We just arrived yesterday but we had to turn around and go home
and be with the people there. It's a very serious matter," he
told reporters as he boarded a flight at Narita airport near
Tokyo.


From Tokyo, Kaine declared a state of emergency to coordinate the
response to the massacre at Virginia Tech University, the worst
school shooting in US hhistory, and ordered flags to fly at half-
staff.


Kaine had been due to hold several days of closed-door talks with
corporate executives in Japan and Hong Kong before joining a
100-strong trade mission on a weeklong tour of India starting
April 22.


There, he had been scheduled to meet with business leaders in New
Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in part to encourage Indian hi-tech
entrepreneurs to invest in Virginia, which has a major IT
industry in the Washington suburbs.
