The Federal Bureau of Investigation said there was no sign the
killing of at least 30 people at a US university on Monday was
the result of terrorism.


"There is no indication that this is an act of terrorism," FBI
spokesman Richard Kolko said in a statement.


"However, every avenue will be investigated."


A gunman opened fire on classrooms at Virginia Tech University on
Monday morning, killing at least 30 people before turning his gun
on himself in the bloodiest school shooting in US history.


Panic erupted on the campus as shots and screams first echoed in
a Virginia Tech University dormitory where students were
preparing for morning classes, followed two hours later by a
massacre in an engineering building.


Police could not confirm whether the same gunman was responsible
for both incidents. The earlier shooting in the dormitory left a
man and a woman dead on the Blacksburg, Virginia campus.


University police and Virginia state police were leading the
investigation into the shooting spree, and the FBI was serving in
an "assistance role only," Kolko said.
