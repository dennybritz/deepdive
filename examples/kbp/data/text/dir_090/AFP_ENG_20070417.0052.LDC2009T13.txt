China is preparing new measures to reinforce protection of the
2008 Olympic Games from intellectual property rights (IPR)
violators, a senior government official said Tuesday.


Zhao Gang, deputy head of the trademark department under the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said China would
strive to keep the Olympics free from piracy.


"During the 2008 Olympic Games, we will launch effective measures
to ensure that this great sports event is as free as possible of
any IPR violations," he told a press conference.


China's cabinet, the State Council, issued regulations in 2002 on
protecting Olympic symbols from copyright violations.


But already fake Olympic products are available on the Internet
and hawkers line commercial streets here selling baseball hats
with the Olympic rings and the Beijing dancing-man Games logo for
roughly one dollar.


"We will soon issue a new plan to prevent the infringement of the
Olympic logo," said Zhao, without elaborating.


The United States last week took China before the World Trade
Organisation over "rampant" abuse of copyright and other
intellectual property rights in China.


Officials of the Beijing Olympic organising committee, BOCOG,
have their own IPR protection office and have pledged to crack
down on violators of Olympic copyright.
