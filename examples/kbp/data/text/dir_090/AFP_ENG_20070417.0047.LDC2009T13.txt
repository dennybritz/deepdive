Japan's Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. said Tuesday that it planned
to buy up to about 51 million dollars' worth of shares in China
CITIC Bank when it goes public later this month.


The Japanese bank, part of Mizuho Financial Group, said it would
be a core investor in the China's seventh largest bank when it
offers 7.19 billion shares in a dual listing in Hong Kong and
Shanghai, set for April 27.


The exact size and price of Mizuho's acquisition has yet to be
determined although the maximum will be 400 million Hong Kong
dollars' ((51.3 million US) worth of shares, the Japanese bank
said in a statement.


CITIC Bank will become the second lender, after Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China last year, to list simultaneously in
Shanghai and Hong Kong.
