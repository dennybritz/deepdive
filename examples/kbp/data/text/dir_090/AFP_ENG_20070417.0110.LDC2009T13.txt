US marine Mario Lozano, accused of "voluntary homicide" in the
March 2005 shooting death of Italian secret service agent Nicola
Calipari, went on trial in absentia Tuesday in a Rome court.


The US military exonerated Lozano in the mysterious so-called
"friendly fire" case, a finding that has never been accepted by
the Italian government.


The incident occurred near Baghdad airport shortly after Calipari
-- who was number two in Italy's military intelligence hierarchy
-- obtained the release of journalist Giuliana Sgrena after she
spent a month in captivity in Iraq.


Both sides agree that Lozano fired on the car carrying Calipari
and Sgrena with Andrea Carpani, a fellow secret service officer,
at the wheel. Calipari was killed, while Sgrena and Carpani were
wounded.


The United States insisted from the start that Lozano followed
the rules of engagement and that the Italians' car was speeding
towards the checkpoint when he opened fire.


Lozani is charged with voluntary homicide in Calipari's death, as
well as two counts of intent to kill Sgrena and Carpani.
