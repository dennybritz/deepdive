An Indian professor is among the 33 people who died in a campus
shooting spree in the United States, his relatives told the media
Tuesday.


G.V. Loganathan, the 51-year-old professor of civil and
environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, where the shooting
took place, was teaching when the gunman went on a rampage, the
Indian media reported.


"He devoted his life to the teaching community. It's very said
that he has to lose this life," the professor's brother G.V.
Palanivel told private NDTV network from southern state of Tamil
Nadu.


Palanivel said that Loganathan's family -- his wife and two
children -- have been living in the US for several decades.


An Indian student, Minal Panchal has been missing since the
incident on Monday and was feared dead, the Press Trust of India
also reported.


A senior official of Indian embassy in Washington will visit the
university, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said.
