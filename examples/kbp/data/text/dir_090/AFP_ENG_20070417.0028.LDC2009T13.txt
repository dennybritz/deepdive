Health officials in New Caledonia issued an alert Tuesday against
a possible epidemic of dengue fever after two cases were reported
in the Pacific Ocean French territory.


A dengue outbreak killed 20 people here in 2003, and the
government said in a statement that the latest cases had affected
people who had not been travelling outside the territory.


That indicated that local mosquitoes were responsible and the
government was "taking seriously" the risk of an epidemic, it
said.


There is no specific treatment or vaccine against dengue fever
but early detection can improve chances of survival.


The illness is transmitted to humans through the bites of
infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and causes a severe, flu-like
illness and internal bleeding.


New Caledonia is around 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) from
Australia, and is best known for containing about 25 percent of
the world's nickel reserves.
