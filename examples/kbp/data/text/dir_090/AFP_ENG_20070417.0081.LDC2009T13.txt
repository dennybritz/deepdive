British supermarket giant Tesco, the country's biggest retailer,
said on Tuesday that 2006 net profits soared by a fifth to a
record 1.892 billion pounds (2.777 billion euros, 3.767 billion
dollars).


Net profits leapt by 20.5 percent to reach the record level,
which compared with a figure of 1.570 billion pounds in 2005, the
group said in its annual earnings release.


Revenue rose by 8.1 percent to 42.641 billion pounds, driven by
growing sales in eastern Europe and Asia, as well as its home
market Britain.


Alongside the results statement, Tesco said it would create
25,000 new jobs around the world this year, while it would also
return 3.0 billion pounds to shareholders.
