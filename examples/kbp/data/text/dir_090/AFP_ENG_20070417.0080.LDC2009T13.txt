German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom proposed Tuesday
to cut the wages of the 50,000 employees in its services division
by 12 percent over the next 30 months in return for job
guarantees until the end of 2010.


In the current tug-of-war with the giant services sector union
Ver.di over the planned shake-up of its services activities,
Deutsche Telekom said in a statement that the salaries of the
employees affected should be cut by 12 percent over a period of
two and a half years.


Deutsche Telekom is planning to transfer 50,000 staff into a
legally separate services company called T-Service at lower pay
and longer hours.


But Ver.di is demanding job protection measures for the affected
employees and has staged a number of temporary walk-outs last
week and again this week in protest at the plans.
