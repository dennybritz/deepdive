The pound surged above 2.0 dollars in early European trading on
Tuesday after the release of unexpectedly strong British
inflation data, dealers said.


The pound jumped as high as 2.0003 dollars, last seen in
September 1992, after news that British 12-month inflation had
hit 3.1 percent in March, the highest level since 1997 and in
breach of a government-set ceiling of 3.0 percent.
