Mexico's army detained on Monday more than a hundred police for
alleged ties to drug traffickers as authorities reported a spree
of drug-related murders.


The police were arrested in 12 municipalities near Monterrey, the
industrial capital of Nuevo Leon, said Omar Cervantes, Nuevo Leon
state spokesman.


The police officers will be investigated to determine their
involvement in several shootings around the state, Cervantes
said.


Some 50 execution-style murders have taken place so far this year
in the area, 18 of those police officers.


Meanwhile, officials said at least 22 people had been killed
around Mexico in drug-related murders over the past 48 hours.


The bodies of five victims, two of them women, were found in an
expensive car at the entrance to a residential neighborhood,
prosecutors in the resort city of Cancun said.


In Guerrero state, at least eight people were executed in 48
hours, said Erit Montufar, director of the local investigative
police, who added that the bodies of two men were found in a car
with gunshot wounds.


"Welcome to all those who want to ally with us. Yours truly, your
friends. Ha, ha, ha," said a note with the bodies.


Three other bodies were found in a garbage dump in Taxco,
Montufar said.


Other execution-style murdered bodies turned up in Tijuana,
Veracruz, Sinaloa, Michoacan and in Mexico City, according to
officials and press reports.


Mexico has deployed more than 20,000 soldiers and federal police
to Guerrero and elsewhere in a national crackdown on drug-related
violence.
