The murder trial in absentia of US marine Mario Lozano, accused
in the March 2005 shooting death of an Italian secret service
agent Nicola Calipari, was adjourned Tuesday to May 14.


An adjournment was requested both by Lozano's defence lawyer, who
asserted that Lozano was unaware of the proceedings, and the
plaintiffs' lawyers, which said a procedure for making former US
defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld a civil party to the trial was
still under way.


The hearing was attended by Calipari's widow Rosa and by
journalist Giuliana Sgrena, who was wounded in the same shooting.


The US military exonerated Lozano in the mysterious so-called
"friendly fire" case, a finding that has never been accepted by
the Italian government.


The incident occurred near Baghdad airport shortly after Calipari
-- who was number two in Italy's military intelligence hierarchy
-- obtained the release of Sgrena after she was held for a month
by kidnappers in Iraq.


Both sides agree that Lozano fired on the car carrying Calipari
and Sgrena and Andrea Carpani, a fellow secret service officer,
who was at the wheel. Calipari was killed, while Sgrena and
Carpani were wounded.


The United States insisted from the start that Lozano followed
the rules of engagement and that the Italians' car was speeding
towards the checkpoint when he opened fire.


Lozani is charged with voluntary homicide in Calipari's death, as
well as two counts of intent to kill Sgrena and Carpani.
