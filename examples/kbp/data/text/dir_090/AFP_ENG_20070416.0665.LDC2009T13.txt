A disgruntled farmer in southwest China has killed a village
leader in a suicide bombing and injured many other local
officials following a land dispute, state press reported Tuesday.


Yue Xiaobao detonated explosives strapped to his body as he
approached officials from Lishan village of Yunnan province on
Sunday afternoon, the Beijing Times reported.


The attack came after village leaders had destroyed Yue's crop
and forced him to plant tobacco, a leading cash crop in the
province, the report said.


Yue carried out the attack while officials were on an inspection
tour of local farmlands, it said.


Yue and Lishan village leader Ren Xuecai were killed immediately.
As of late Monday, nine others wounded were in stable condition
but many were expected to lose their eyesight, it said. Most of
the wounded were local officials.


Yue reportedly threatened to kill Ren after village officials
destroyed his crop of sweet potatoes and forced him to grow
tobacco, but Ren dismissed the threat, saying: "I'm not afraid of
you."


Land rights have become one of China's most serious social issues
in recent years as local officials often use their powers to
implement land-use policies unpopular with local residents.


As China's real estate market has boomed over the last decade,
many residents have also accused government officials of
colluding with developers to cash in on the hot property market.
