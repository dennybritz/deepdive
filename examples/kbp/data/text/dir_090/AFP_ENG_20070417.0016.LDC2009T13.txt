A warm winter, rather than an undervalued currency, played a key
role in boosting China's foreign trade surplus in the first two
months of the year, state media reported Tuesday.


The warm winter in regions such as Europe particularly affected
China's textiles and garments orders and shipments and the export
of air-conditioners, the Xinhua news agency said, citing business
analysts and industrial experts.


"The warm winter induced Chinese businesses to export summer
garments early," said Cao Xinyu, vice chairman of the China
Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Textiles, according
to Xinhua.


He said usually the garments are exported in the second quarter.


"That is the reason for the massive spike in China's exports of
textiles and garments in the first two months and also a key
reason for the huge surplus in foreign trade," Cao added.


The trade surplus in the textiles and garments industry reached
21.6 billion dollars in the first two months of the year, with
exports up 40 percent to hit 24 billion dollars, according to
customs figures.


The overall trade surplus jumped 56.5 percent to 39.6 billion
dollars in the period, triggering growing calls on the yuan to
rise as trade partners claimed it had given Chinese exporters an
unfair competitive edge.
