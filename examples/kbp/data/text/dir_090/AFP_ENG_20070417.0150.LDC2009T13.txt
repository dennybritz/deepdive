The pound climbed above 2.0 dollars for the first time for 14
years on Tuesday after data showed British annual inflation
surged to a decade-high above 3.0 percent in March, dealers said.


The pound jumped as high as 2.0003 dollars, last seen in
September 1992, after news that British 12-month inflation had
hit 3.1 percent last month, the highest level since 1997 and in
breach of a government-set ceiling of 3.0 percent.


"This is a thoroughly nasty set of data that essentially
guarantees that the Bank of England will raise interest rates by
a further 25 basis points to 5.50 percent in May," said Global
Insight Howard Archer.


Bank of England governor Mervyn King must now write a letter to
British finance minister Gordon Brown, explaining why he has
failed to keep 12-month inflation within target.


The central bank was due to publish the letter at 0930 GMT.
