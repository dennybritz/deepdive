NASA said on Monday it plans to launch four space shuttle
missions this year instead of five, due to the delay caused after
hail damage sustained by the shuttle Atlantis in February.


"The space shuttle and International Space Station programs
agreed to the changes during a meeting to evaluate options
following the (Atlantis) mission's delay, which was caused by
hail damage to the external fuel tank," it said.


Atlantis is now to launch by June 8 at the earliest. It is to be
the first mission this year, and after its initially scheduled
launch was delayed from March 15.


The next launch, of the Endeavour, is planned for August 9 or
shortly thereafter. Following that is to be the Discovery, to
launch by October 20 at the earliest.


The last of the year is to be Atlantis on or after December 6.


NASA agreed on the changes at a meeting Monday. The space agency
forecasts 13 missions are needed to complete work on the
International Space Station by 2010.
