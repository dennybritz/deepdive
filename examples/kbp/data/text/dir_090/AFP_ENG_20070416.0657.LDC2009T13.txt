China's Ministry of Railways may be forced to lower ticket prices
for its new bullet train services, which begin on April 18, due
to disappointing initial sales, state media said Tuesday.


Fares on the new services were 50 percent higher than current
express trains as bullet trains promise to reduce journey times
by several hours between major cities, the official Xinhua news
agency reported.


Tickets for the first bullet train services went on sale on April
14 but in some cities sales have been sluggish, with the high
prices being blamed, the report said.


"We have noticed public opinion about the ticket prices and will
consider slashing prices on the basis of market conditions in the
future," Wang Yongping, spokesman with the ministry, was quoted
as saying.


With speeds of 200 to 250 kilometres (125 to 155 miles) per hour,
the bullet trains will expand national railway passenger capacity
by 18 percent, or an addition of 340,000 seats a day, alleviating
ticket shortages during holidays.


They will also increase China's cargo capacity by 12 percent.


"But it will not be possible for China to completely eliminate
the shortages until 2020 when the country's railway network
lengthens to 100,000 kilometres (60,000 miles)," Wang said.
