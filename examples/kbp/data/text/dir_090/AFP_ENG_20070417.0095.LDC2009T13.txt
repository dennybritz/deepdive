European stock markets slid in opening deals on Tuesday, with
London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares down 0.11 percent at
6,509.20 points after striking a six-year peak the previous day.


The British capital's FTSE 100 index had closed Monday at the
highest level since September 14, 2000, as investors spied a
potential bidding war for control of Dutch bank ABN Amro.


Elsewhere in opening deals on Tuesday, Frankfurt's DAX 30
declined 0.14 percent to 7,327.50 points, and in Paris the CAC 40
index lost 0.30 percent to 5,844.49.
