Bangladesh's last prime minister Khaleda Zia has agreed to be
exiled in a deal with the military-backed government in return
for leniency for her sons, who are accused of corruption, an aide
told AFP Tuesday.


"Zia has agreed to leave the country but she is taking her time,"
said the aide, who was speaking on condition he was not
identified.


It confirmed widespread reports in the Bangladeshi press, citing
government officials, that Zia was being forced out as part of a
major drive against the country's rampant political corruption.


She has been under virtual house arrest since last week.
