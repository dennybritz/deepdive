Five United Nations security guards including four Nepalese were
killed Tuesday when a roadside bomb blast ripped through their
vehicle in southern Afghanistan, police said.


The attack happened in the southern city of Kandahar, the
birthplace of the Taliban movement that has waged an increasingly
fierce insurgency against targets including aid workers since
being ousted in 2001.


"Four Nepalese and an Afghan who were working for the UN security
services were killed in a very powerful remote-controlled
explosion," provincial police chief Esmatullah Alizai told AFP.


Police at the scene previously said that two Nepalese and two
Afghans died.


The bomb almost completely destroyed the armoured UN vehicle and
its smoking wreckage lay across a road near the centre of the
city. Police were trying to remove two bodies trapped inside, an
AFP reporter witnessed.


UN spokesman Aleem Siddique said there was a "roadside bomb
explosion against a UN convoy which was going to its base in
Kandahar" but had no details of casualties.


There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but
previous such blasts have been blamed on the fundamentalist
Islamic Taliban militia.


Human Rights Watch said in a report published Monday that
civilian deaths from "war crimes" and other attacks by Taliban-
led insurgents have soared in the past 15 months.


At least 669 Afghan civilians had died since the start of 2006,
the report said.
