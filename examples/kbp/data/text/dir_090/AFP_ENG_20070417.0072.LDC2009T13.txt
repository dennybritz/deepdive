Japanese computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. said Tuesday that its net
profit rose by about 49 percent to a record high in the year to
March, boosted by the sale of shares in the technology firm Fanuc
Co.


Fujitsu now expects a 102 billion yen (855.5 million dollars) net
profit for the full-year period, up from an earlier forecast of
80 billion and the previous's year's 68.5 billion, the company
said in a statement.


"Projected net income is expected to exceed the company's
previous record level of net income posted in fiscal 1984,"
Fujitsu said in a statement.


The company sold about 70.0 billion yen worth of Fanuc shares,
generating a net gain of about 40.0 billion yen, which offset
asset devaluation losses that resulted from a sluggish recovery
of the optical transmission business.


Fujitsu said its net sales rose by about 6.4 percent to 5.1
trillion yen in the year to March, while operating profit was
roughly steady at 182 billion yen compared with 181.4 billion a
year ago.


Previously it had forecast an operating profit of 190 billion
yen.


"Operating income projections are being lowered because of delays
in the recovery of the company's optical transmission business,"
Fujitsu said in a statement.


Fujitsu will publish its final results for the full-year period
on April 26.
