Defending world champion Fernando Alonso believes only Ferrari
misfortune will help him win Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix.


The 25-year-old Spaniard reckons his McLaren-Mercedes-Benz team
has not made sufficient progress in recent testing to threaten
Ferrari in on-track performance and needed some luck to help them
win.


"It will be difficult to beat them, but I think we need to push
them," he said.


"In Australia, they had two mechanical problems - one on Massa's
car, on Saturday, and Kimi nearly on Sunday. So, we need to be
there if we want to win. We have to push them to the limit."


Finn Kimi Raikkonen won from pole to the flag in Melbourne on his
debut for the Ferrari team and he and team-mate Brazilian Felipe
Massa performed with confident aplomb and superior performance
for most of the weekend until Massa was hit by engine problems.


"I think the gap in Australia was too big, too much," Alonso
reflected.


"Now, even if we develop the car, the gap will be closer because
we made some improvements, but we still have a little bit more to
do.


"But Ferrari have been quickest in both sessions, with Massa and
Kimi in the top positions as well, so I think Ferrari will again
be our main competitor. If we are going to be on pole position or
win the race then we need to beat them. They are the team to beat
at the moment."
