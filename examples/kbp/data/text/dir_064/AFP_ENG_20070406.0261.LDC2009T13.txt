Rwanda's first post-genocide president, Pasteur Bizimungu, was
Friday freed from prison where he was serving a 15-year sentence
for crimes that included fanning ethnic hostility, a justice
ministry official said.


"I can confirm that he has been released this morning," the
official told AFP, requesting anonymity.


Bizimungu's release comes the day before ceremonies to mark the
13th anniversary of the start of the Rwandan genocide of ethnic
Tutsis by Hutu extremists.
