Poor countries will be worst hit by climate change, the UN's top
experts on global warming said in a report released here on
Friday.


"Poor people are the most vulnerable and will be the worst hit by
the impacts of climate change. This becomes a global
responsibility," said the chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri.
