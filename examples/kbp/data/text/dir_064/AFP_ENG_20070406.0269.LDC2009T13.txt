Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko on Friday met with Prime
Minister Viktor Yanukovych, the president's office said, amid a
deepening power struggle between the two political rivals.


"The principle topic of the meeting is how to get out of the
political crisis," the office said in a statement.


Yushchenko triggered the stand-off on Monday when he announced he
was dissolving parliament and called snap elections after
accusing lawmakers of violating the constitution.


Supporters of the prime minister have condemned the order as
unconstitutional and have called on the president to resign.


In addition to the two leaders, Deputy Prime Minister Mykola
Azarov and presidential officials will take part in the meeting,
the statement said.


Yanukovych and Yushchenko had met to discuss the crisis on
Tuesday, but no breakthrough was achieved.
