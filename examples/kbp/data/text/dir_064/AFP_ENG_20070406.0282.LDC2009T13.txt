Zambia's founding president Kenneth Kaunda has been admitted to
hospital following a sudden change in his blood pressure, his
spokesman said on Friday.


Kaunda, 82, was admitted to the state-run University Teaching
Hospital early on Thursday although his condition is not life-
threatening, the spokesman Duncan Mtonga said.


"His condition is stable and may be discharged today," Mtonga
added.


The octogenarian politician, who ruled this southern African
nation for 27 years from 1964, will turn 83 later this month.
