German number one Tommy Haas beat Belgium's Kristof Vliegen 6-7
(4/7), 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 here on Friday to put them ahead in their
Davis Cup World Group quarter- final tie.


The 29-year-old Haas won the opening rubber in three hours, 18
minutes on his third match point to send debutant and teammate
Philipp Kohlschreiber into his singles match against Olivier
Rochus with a 1-0 lead.


"There was enormous pressure," Haas said afterwards. "The second
set was very important and had I not been able to get back into
the match then, it would have got very tight. Vliegen is a really
unpredictable opponent."


The winner of this best-of-five rubber tie will move into the
September 21 to 23 semi-finals against either title holders
Russia or France, which for Germany would mean away matches
against either opponent.
