A Cuban doctor who refused to return home after working in Gabon
sought asylum in France on Friday when he stopped there after
being deported, one of his lawyers said.


Maulio Garcia Perez was finally flown out of Gabon on Thursday
evening towards Cuba, Gabonese foreign ministry spokesman Jean-
Claude Mendome told AFP, weeks after he was due to leave.


One of Perez's lawyers confirmed that a Cuban diplomat picked him
up from his home and took him to Libreville airport with the help
of Gabonese police.


"He was due to board a plane for Paris, from where he was to
continue towards Cuba, but I have just heard that he asked for
asylum in France this morning (Friday) when he arrived," Jules
Obiang told AFP.


Perez arrived in Gabon in March 2005 with about 20 colleagues as
part of a cooperative agreement between Libreville and Havana.


He worked in the public hospital in Port-Gentil, in the southwest
of Gabon, and should have returned to Cuba on March 13.


Instead, he fled towards the border with Cameroon where he was
arrested by Gabonese immigration officers.


Obiang said the doctor did not oppose Fidel Castro's regime in
Cuba but feared reprisals if he returned there.


"He applied for asylum in Gabon on March 28. His deportation was
due to be suspended until his case was considered, but they went
ahead with it. I don't know where that decision came from," the
lawyer added.
