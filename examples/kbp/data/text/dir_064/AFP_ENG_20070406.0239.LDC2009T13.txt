A Syrian rights activist is being held alone in an underground
cell in total darkness where his health is deteriorating, a
statement by a number of Syrian rights groups said on Friday.


Kamal Labwani, who was arrested at Damascus airport in November
2005 after returning from tours of the United States and Europe,
is being held "in solitary confinement in an underground cell,"
said the statement from eight organisations.


When Labwani's family visited him on Wednesday they found him
"clothes torn, barefoot, held in a tiny cell infested with
insects and rats, in total darkness and with broken toilets
creating an unbearable stench," the statement said.


Labwani "is suffering from several skin diseases, including
scabies," it added.


During his time abroad, Labwani met European and US officials to
call for peaceful democratic reform inside Syria. He is charged
with "encouraging foreign aggression against Syria."


Friday's statement called on the authorities to "intervene
immediately to put an end to this unjustifiable behaviour and
guarantee dignified conditions for political prisoners."


Washington last month slammed Damascus for arbitrarily detaining
political opponents, and voiced particular concern for Labwani
and fellow political prisoner Anwar Bunni.


Bunni, a lawyer, was arrested last May after signing a petition
urging Syria to improve strained relations with Lebanon.


US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, visited Syria on
Wednesday in the first such high-profile trip in years that was
strongly criticised by the White House which wants to isolate the
regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
