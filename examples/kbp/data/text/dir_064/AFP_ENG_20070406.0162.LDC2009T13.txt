Japanese ace Takao Suzuki powered past Weerapat Doakmaiklee to
give his nation a 2-0 lead over Thailand in a Davis Cup tie on
Friday.


The 30-year-old Suzuki, who has a 20-11 record in Davis Cup play,
fired home 10 aces and needed just 97 minutes for his straight
sets 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 win.


Thailand are without their top two players -- 2002 Asian Games
gold medallist Paradorn Srichaphan and 2006 champion Danai
Udomchoke -- who are sidelined due to injuries.


Earlier on the indoor court at the Namihaya Dome, Go Soeda put
Japan one up by overwhelming Kittipong Wachiramanowong 6-1, 6-2,
6-2.


On Saturday, Suzuki will team up with Satoshi Iwabuchi for a
doubles match against twin brothers Sonchat and Sanchai
Ratiwatana.


The winning side will advance to a play-off for a place in the
World Group next year.


Japan are 5-2 against Thailand in the Davis Cup since their first
encounter in 1958.
