Workers at the US company charged with putting up campaign
posters in voting stations for France's upcoming presidential
elections on Friday ended their strike, unions said.


Several of Clear Channel's sites across France had been hit by
the strike that began Monday, with unions demanding 200 euros
(267 dollars) extra a month for those earning less than 1,600
euros.


Unions said Friday they had squeezed a "satisfactory" compromise
out of the company, but did not provide details.


Clear Channel, the world's top outdoor advertising company, for
its part said the election posters would go up on time.


About a million posters, one large and one small for each of the
12 presidential candidates, are due to go up from next Monday in
France's 85,000 polling booths ahead of the elections whose first
round is on April 22.
