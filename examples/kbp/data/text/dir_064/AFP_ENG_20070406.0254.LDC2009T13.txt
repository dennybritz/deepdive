Spanish soldiers taking part in a United Nations peacekeeping
force in Lebanon have found an arms depot that included 17 rocket
launchers in a mountainous area in the southeast of the country,
the defence ministry said Friday.


The soldiers also found a concrete setting which could be used to
launch the Bulgarian-made rockets at the location near the town
of Rachaya el Foukhar, the ministry said in a statement.


"The depot was camouflaged in a hard to reach area and the
weapons were in a sealed barrel beside a small stream," it said.


The arms were handed over to the Lebanese army, the ministry
said.


Spain has deployed nearly 1,100 troops to southeastern Lebanon
near the border with Israel as part of the the UN Interim Force
in Lebanon (UNIFIL) which has a total of 12,700 soldiers from 30
countries.


UNIFIL first deployed in Lebanon in 1978 after an Israeli
invasion but was expanded from some 2,000 members after the July-
August war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.
