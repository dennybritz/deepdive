Poland is considering strengthening its military contingent in
Iraq following a spate of attacks on its bases there, military
officials were quoted as saying Friday.


"According to the commander of the ground forces (General
Waldemar Skrzypczak), we have to change the character of our
mission," his spokesman,  Slawomir Lewandowski, told AFP.


"This could mean raising the number of fighting forces in the
contingent."


Poland, which has backed the United States since the start of the
Iraq crisis, has 900 soldiers there. The mission is tasked with
training Iraqi troops.


A total of 24 Poles, including soldiers and journalists, have
been killed in Iraq since 2003.


Another senior Polish general echoed Skrzypczak's view.


"We have to quickly address the question of what do do in Iraq:
end the mission in nine months, or not?" General Henryk Tacik
said in Iraq.


"We have to ask ourselves, do we maintain the contingent at its
current level or raise it?" he was quoted as saying Friday in the
Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.


Poland has extended the mandate of its troops in Iraq until the
end of this year.
