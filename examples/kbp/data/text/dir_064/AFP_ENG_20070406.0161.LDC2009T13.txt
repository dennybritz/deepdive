Sri Lanka is building a new international cricket stadium in the
island's arid southern province, Sri Lanka Cricket said on
Friday.


The new stadium in Ranna village in the southern district of
Hambantota, which is also the home constituency of President
Mahinda Rajapakse, will host international matches.


Initial work on the stadium, 238 kilometers (149 miles) from
Colombo, is due to be completed by the end of next year, Sri
Lanka Cricket secretary K. Mathivanan told AFP.


"We have not worked out the total costs yet," he said, adding
construction tenders had been called.


Sri Lanka has six international cricket venues, including three
in Colombo.


The Galle stadium, badly damaged by the December 2004 tsunami, is
being rebuilt and there are plans to hold a Test match when
England tours the island during October-November, Mathivanan
said.
