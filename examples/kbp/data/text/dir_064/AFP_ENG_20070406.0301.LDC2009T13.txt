The Zambian government has sold its largest state-run commercial
bank to Rabobank of The Netherlands in a deal worth more than
eight million dollars, a minister announced Friday.


Rabobank has taken over the management of the Zambia National
Commercial Bank (ZNCB) with immediate effect after wrapping up
protracted negotiations, Commerce Minister Kenneth Konga said.


"Rabobank, in making their bid, took into account some
adjustments such as consultancy fees to arrive at the net bid of
8,250,000 US dollars," Konga said.


The Dutch firm will effectively take control of 45 percent of the
shares with management rights while 25 percent of the shares will
be floated on the Lusaka stock exchange with the government
retaining the minority shares.


The opposition and trade unions in Zambia had protested against
the sale, fearing the new owners could cut jobs and close
unprofitable branches in rural areas.


Rabobank has promised to maintain the rural branches, which
service the poor communities throughout the country.
