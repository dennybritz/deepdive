A Palestinian who was shot last year in clashes with Israeli
troops died from his wounds Friday, medical sources said.


Mohammad al-Shawaf, 22, was from the rural farming village of
Abbasan east of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. Abbasan
was the site of repeated Israeli incursions after Palestinian
militants seized Corporal Gilad Shalit in a June cross-border
raid.


Since the start of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising,
in September 2000, 5,656 people have now died, most of them
Palestinians, according to an AFP count.
