The German sportswear manufacturer Puma has trimmed its share
capital by 7.4 percent amid rumours that French luxury goods
empire PPR could launch a takeover bid.


Puma said in a statement after stock markets closed on Thursday
that it was lowering its listed capital from 44.12 million euros
(59.19 million dollars) to 40.87 million.


This is to be achieved through the cancellation of some 1.27
million shares.


The French retail group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR), which
owns a range of top-end fashion brands including Yves Saint
Laurent and Gucci, has declined to confirm or deny rumours that
it has designs on Puma.


On Friday, the Wall Street Journal quoted sources close to the
matter as saying that PPR was close to agreement on the purchase
of a 30-percent stake in Puma from the Herz family.


That would value the entire group at around 5.4 billion euros.


Ongoing speculation has seen Puma shares surge in trading on the
Frankfurt stock exchange.


On Thursday, they leapt by 10.38 percent to 315 euros, while the
DAX index of leading shares closed 0.37 percent higher overall.


Puma posted sales of 2.37 billion dollars in 2006 and is upbeat
on prospects for this year, making the group a choice morsel for
investors unable to go after sector giants like Nike and Adidas.


In March, PPR said it was holding 1.070 billion euros in cash,
providing it with a well-stocked warchest if the retailer decided
to bid for another group.
