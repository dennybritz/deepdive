A total of 360 Nigerians deported by Libyan authorities after
serving their jail sentences have arrived in Lagos, relief
officials who received them at the airport told AFP Friday.


The deportees, including about 40 women, had served various jail
terms on drug- related offences they allegedly committed while in
the north African country, one of the officials said.


In Tripoli, the Libyan authorities granted them pardon before
expelling them, he said.


An AFP journalist who saw the deportees where they were camped
said that they looked "tough and rugged", apparently a
consequence of their drug and prison experiences.


This brings to 473 the total number of Nigerians deported from
Libya since last week, an official of the National Emergency
Management Authority said.


Last week, 113 Nigerians were deported from Libya, mostly for
illegal immigration.


Friday morning at the "Hajj Camp" near Lagos international
airport where the deporters were gathered, officials of the anti-
drug agency NDLEA were seen screening the new arrivals.


Security at the "camp" was very tight as visitors and journalists
were barred from gaining entry into it.


"After the screening by the officials of the National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), the deportees will be let off to
rejoin their families in Nigeria," an official said.
