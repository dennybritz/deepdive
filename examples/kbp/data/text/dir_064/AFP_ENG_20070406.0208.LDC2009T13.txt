Thailand's Pongsaklek Wongjongkam defended his World Boxing
Council flyweight title for the 17th consecutive time here
Friday, defeating Japanese challenger Tomonobu Shimizu.


The 29-year-old Thai boxer was declared the winner half-way into
the 12-round bout held in Saraburi, 105 kilometres (65 miles)
north of Bangkok.


Pongsaklek sent Shimizu down in round seven before winning by
technical knock out.


His victory improved his record to 64-2, with 33 knockouts.


The referee suspended the fight for almost 10 minutes when dozens
of yellow balloons exploded near the ringside.


The helium balloons apparently ignited after someone held a lit
cigarette too close, startling the fighters just one minute into
the first round.


After the fight, promoter Virat Vachirarattanawong said
Pongsaklek plans to set yet another record by the end of the
year.


"He plans to defend his 20th title on December 5 to celebrate his
majesty the king's 80th birthday," he said.


Pongsaklek faces his next challenger in June when he battles
Naito Daisuke from Japan.


He became the first Thai to enter the WBC's star-studded Hall of
Fame in 2005.
