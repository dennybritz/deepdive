Former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said
Friday that Saudi's King Abdullah was "mistaken" when he
questioned the legality of the US military presence in Iraq and
should "correct" his controversial remarks on the matter.


"With all due respect to the King, it's a mistake to characterise
the US presence in Iraq as illegal," Bolton said in an interview
with the US-based Arabic language Al-Hurra television station.


King Abdullah, a key ally of Washington in the Middle East,
described the US occupation of Iraq as "illegitimate" at a
meeting of Arab leaders last week in the Saudi capital Riyadh.


"In beloved Iraq, blood is being shed among brothers in the
shadow of an illegitimate foreign occupation and ugly
sectarianism threatens civil war," Abdullah said.


US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice telephoned Saudi Arabia's
US ambassador specifically to disuss the remark.


Bolton said the US was in Iraq at the invitation of its
government and its presence was further sanctioned by a United
Nations Security Council resolution.


"I hope he (King Abdullah) finds an opportunity to correct that
remark in the very near future," Bolton said.


Bolton, who was also formerly undersecretary of state for arms
control and international security, was a staunch backer of the
war in Iraq.
