Inhabitants of Russia's southern city of Stavropol are trying to
save a forest endangered by a property development by hanging
photos of President Vladimir Putin on the trees, a report said
Friday.


The local authorities had decided to construct a residential
quarter in the zone and had already started cutting the trees,
but a group of residents opposed to the scheme reckoned that they
would be able to save their forest thanks to the magic of Putin.


"The mayor of Stavropol says all the time that he supports the
president. We thought that he wouldn't dare touch (the image of)
Vladimir Vladimirovitch," Olga Gavrish, one of the militants,
told the Izvestia daily.


The woodcutters "cut only the trunks without (the photos of)
Vladimir Vladimirovitch. If there is his portrait on the trunk,
they are afraid," another resident, Inna Bakulina, told the
newspaper.


The residents patrol every evening to make sure that the photos
of the president are not pulled off.


The government of Stavropol was not available for comment Friday.
