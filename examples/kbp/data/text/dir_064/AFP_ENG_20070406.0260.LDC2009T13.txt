Taliban extremists torched or damaged nearly two dozen music and
video shops selling "un-Islamic" materials in a small town in
eastern Afghanistan, an official said Friday.


The fundamentalist rebels also left leaflets warning that
merchants in Alisher in eastern Khost province will be "badly
punished" if they do not stop selling CDs and DVDs, police
official Wazir Badshah said.


"The enemies came and burned down some nine music shops and
destroyed the doors of 12 others. They've also dropped leaflets
in the area threatening to punish people selling musical
materials," Badshah said.


He said the act was aimed at creating fear amongst residents and
to show the weakness of the government of US-backed President
Hamid Karzai.


The hardline Taliban, who were in power between 1996 and 2001
when they were toppled by US-led forces, banned music and most
entertainments such as kite flying during their rule. Violators
faced months in jail.


Taliban rebels have stepped up a bloody insurgency in the past
two years.
