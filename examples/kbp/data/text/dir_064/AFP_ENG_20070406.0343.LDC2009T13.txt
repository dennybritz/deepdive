German historian Werner Maser, considered one of the world's
leading experts on Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, has died at the
age of 84, his family said on Friday.


Maser won international acclaim with a biography of the late Nazi
dictator titled "Hitler: Legend, Myth and Reality." It was
published in 1971 and translated into 22 languages.


Another work, "Hitler's Letters and Notes", gave deep insight
into Hitler's thoughts and theories.


Maser was praised for its neutrality and his painstaking
research.


His credibility was compromised, however, when he claimed in the
late 1970s to have tracked down Hitler's illegitimate son,
allegedly born of an 18-month liaison between the Fuehrer and a
peasant girl.


Maser also penned a biography of former German chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
