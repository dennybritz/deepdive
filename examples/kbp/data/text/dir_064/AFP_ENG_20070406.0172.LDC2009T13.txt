Japan's leading optical glass maker Hoya Corp. said Friday it was
considering launching a tender offer for Pentax Corp, a digital
cameras manufacturer, instead of a merger through a share swap.


The two companies agreed last December to merge their operations
through a share swap that would take effect from October 2007,
but Hoya said in a statement that it may offer to buy Pentax
shares instead.


The Nikkei business daily reported in its evening edition that
Hoya has proposed a new merger plan under which it will raise its
proposed offer for Pentax by about 20 percent to 770 yen per
share to secure the support of shareholders.


The two companies, which are both manufacturers of medical
equipment, had said in December they planned to sign a contract
in April and integrate into Hoya Pentax HD Corp as of October 1.
