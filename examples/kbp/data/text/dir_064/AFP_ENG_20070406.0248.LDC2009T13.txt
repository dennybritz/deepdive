US employers added 180,000 jobs in March, the government said
Friday in a sign of stronger-than-expected economic activity.


The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent a
month earlier, the Labor Department said.


The increase in nonfarm payrolls, seen as one of the best
indicators of economic momentum, was much stronger that the gain
of 135,000 expected on Wall Street.


Additionally, the agency revised up its estimate for February to
show 113,000 new jobs were created instead of 97,000, and for
January to 162,000 from 146,000.
