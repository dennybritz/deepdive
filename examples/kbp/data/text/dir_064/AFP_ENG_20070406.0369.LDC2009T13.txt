The United States said Friday it has found a "technical pathway"
to return frozen funds to North Korea, in a development linked to
negotiations over the reclusive state's nuclear program.


"We believe that we have identified a way to do that, but at this
point the US does not have an active role in doing that," said US
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack.


US negotiators left Beijing earlier on Friday without resolving a
financial sanctions dispute that threatens to derail efforts to
end North Korea's nuclear program.


Senior US Treasury official Daniel Glaser and his colleagues left
after 13 days of talks, the US embassy in Beijing said, without
any deal announced on the return to North Korea of about 25
million dollars frozen in a Macau bank.


The departure of the US negotiators cast further doubt over
whether North Korea may miss an initial deadline to shut down its
key nuclear facilities by April 14.


Under a six-nation agreement signed here in February, North Korea
agreed to disable its Yongbyon reactor and allow UN nuclear
inspectors back into the country by the deadline in exchange for
economic aid and diplomatic concessions.
