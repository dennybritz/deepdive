The 15 British naval personnel seized by Iran on Friday went back
on "confessions" made on Iranian television and insisted they
were in Iraqi waters when detained.


"I can clearly state we were 1.7 nautical miles from Iranian
territorial waters," Royal Marine Captain Chris Air told a press
conference as he read a joint statement on behalf of the group.


Several of the group were paraded on Iranian television and made
apologies for having entered Iranian waters. British ministers
said the so-called confessions appeared coerced.
