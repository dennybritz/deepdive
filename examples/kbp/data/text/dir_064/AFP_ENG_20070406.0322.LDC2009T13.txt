Israeli police should evict Jewish settlers from a house in the
West Bank town of Hebron within the next 12 days, deputy defence
minister Ephraim Sneh said on Friday.


The hardline settlers took over the house on March 19 claiming
that they had bought it -- a charge rejected as a lie by the
Palestinian owners.


"This presence in the heart of Hebron is illegal," Sneh said on
public radio, stressing that the settlers should be moved out by
police "between now and April 18".


About 200 Jewish settlers moved in to the three-storey building
on a road linking Hebron to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.


Sneh said that any real estate transaction in the West Bank must
have the approval of the Israeli "civil administration" in the
Palestinian territory which was not the case with the house
involved.


Hebron has long been a flashpoint between Palestinians and
Israelis. Under an agreement with the Palestinian Authority,
Israel evacuated 80 percent of Hebron in 1997, leaving a
settlement of several hundred Jewish settlers, protected by its
soldiers, around the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a site holy to both
Jews and Muslims.
