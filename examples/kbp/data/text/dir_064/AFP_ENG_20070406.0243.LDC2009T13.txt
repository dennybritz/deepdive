The US military on Friday announced the deaths of two more
soldiers in Iraq in separate attacks.


One soldier was killed and two others wounded when a roadside
bomb exploded near their vehicle in the restive Diyala province,
north of Baghdad, on Thursday, the military said.


A second soldier was killed and another wounded in a gun attack
in the northern oil hub of Kirkuk on the same day, a separate
statement said.


The latest fatalities brought the US military's losses in Iraq
since the 2003 invasion to 3,263, according to an AFP count based
on Pentagon figures.
