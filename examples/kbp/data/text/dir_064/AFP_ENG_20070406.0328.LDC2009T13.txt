Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a possible contender for the
2008 Republican US presidential nomination, apologized in a video
posted on YouTube for calling Spanish the language of the ghetto.


Gingrich said that what he meant to say was that it was necessary
to speak English well to be successful in the United States. And
he said US funds would be better spent on intensive English
courses than on bilingual education for children in the United
States.


Hispanics are the largest US minority group and some US Hispanic
groups were outraged by the conservative's remarks.


The United States has no official language, though the federal
government operates in English. More than 80 percent of the US
population of over 300 million people speak English only at home,
but Spanish is the country's second most widely spoken language.
