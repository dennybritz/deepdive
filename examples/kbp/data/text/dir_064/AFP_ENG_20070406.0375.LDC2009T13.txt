Thomas Johansson beat David Nalbandian 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7/2), 6-2,
7-6 (7/0) to put Sweden 1-0 ahead against Argentina in their
Davis Cup World Group quarter- final tie here on Friday.


The 32-year-old Johansson required nearly four hours to beat
Nalbandian, seven years his junior, in a match where the first
two sets were hotly-contested.


Nalbandian dominated the first set tiebreak after they traded
breaks during the set, using his powerful service to good effect.
However Johansson managed to level the tie at a set apiece mainly
thanks to him getting his service in the groove.


Johansson rained down a total of 33 aces, to Nalbandian's 18, and
thrashed the Argentinian in the fourth set tiebreak 7-0. The
crowd often showed their displeasure of Nalbandian's temperament
during the match by whistling.
