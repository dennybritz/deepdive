The Islamic Army in Iraq, one of the main Sunni insurgent groups,
has urged Osama bin Laden to rein in Al-Qaeda in Iraq which it
says has killed more than 30 insurgents from other organisations.


Underscoring tensions between factions fighting US forces and
Shiite militia, the Islamic Army in a long website commentary
condemned the activities of the Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda, which
controls another group called the Islamic State in Iraq, headed
by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi.


"We call on the leaders of Al-Qaeda, especially Sheikh Osama bin
Laden, may God protect him... to assume their responsibilities
towards the activities of the Al-Qaeda Organisation in
Mesopotamia," said the commentary.


The Islamic Army, formed by members of the former Baathist ruling
regime of executed president Saddam Hussein, made a highly
conditional offer in October 2006 to negotiate with the US
military, while ruling out any contact with the US-backed Iraqi
authorities.


The movement demanded a pledge from Washington that it would
withdraw its troops, free Iraqi and Arab detainees and "recognise
the Iraqi resistance as the sole legitimate representative of the
Iraqi people."
