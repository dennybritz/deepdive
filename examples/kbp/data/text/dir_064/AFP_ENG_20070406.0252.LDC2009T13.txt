US employers added 180,000 jobs in March, the government said
Friday in a sign of stronger-than-expected economic activity.


The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent from 4.5 percent a
month earlier, the Labor Department said.


The increase in nonfarm payrolls, seen as one of the best
indicators of economic momentum, was much stronger that the gain
of 135,000 expected on Wall Street.


Additionally, the agency revised up its estimate for February to
show 113,000 new jobs were created instead of 97,000, and for
January to 162,000 from 146,000.


The overall employment gain was led by 137,000 new service sector
jobs, including 54,000 in education and health.


The report cited a rise of 56,000 construction jobs, essentially
erasing a similarly steep drop in February, which had been the
sharpest decline in the sector since 1991.


Average hourly wages rose 0.3 percent in March to 17.22 dollars.
Earnings have risen 4.0 percent in the past year.


The average workweek rose slightly to 33.9 hours in March from
33.8 in the prior month.


The job and wage gains are likely to allay concern about
softening US economic conditions, but could prompt increased
concerns about wage-driven inflation.


The Federal Reserve, citing a tight labor market, has indicated
it remains vigilant on inflation and could lift interest rates to
keep price pressures in check. The Fed has left its base federal
funds rate at 5.25 percent since June.
