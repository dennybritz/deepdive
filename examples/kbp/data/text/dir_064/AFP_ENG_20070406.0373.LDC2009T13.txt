Transport in Africa is lagging far behind the rest of the world,
the African Union's infrastructure commissioner stressed Friday
at the start of a meeting of transport ministers.


"Africa has let itself fall behind in building transport
infrastructures, in their interconnection and their quality,"
Bernard Zoba said.


He emphasised that for an area of 30 million square kilometres
(12 million square miles), Africa has only 89,300 kilometres
(55,800 miles) of railway, one 20th of the density in Europe.


He lamented the fact that none of the nine trans-African routes
identified for more than two decades had been realised.


Citing AU figures, Zoba added that Africa represents less than
4.5 percent of global air traffic, of which only a third is
carried on African airlines.


He regretted that travellers between two points in Africa often
have to fly via Europe.


"The problem of intra-African air travel is acutely felt," Zoba
said.


The AU commission's 2007 strategic plan contains a priority
programme for developing transport in Africa, consisting of
enhancing links and improving rail, air, road and water travel
and services.


The agenda for the meeting of the African minister included a
draft plan for integrated transport, in particular harmonising
rail systems between countries.
