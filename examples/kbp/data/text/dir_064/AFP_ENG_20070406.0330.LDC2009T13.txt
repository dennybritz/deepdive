Eight Kurdish politicians were sentenced to three years and nine
months in jail Friday for aiding armed Kurdish rebels fight a
bloody campaign in Turkey's southeast, court officials said.


All the defendants were from the Democratic Society Party (DTP),
the main Kurdish party in Turkey which has recently become the
target of a judicial crackdown by authorities.


The trial against Hidir Aytac, the head of the DTP provincial
branch in the eastern city of Tunceli, and seven other party
members was launched after a militant from the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK) implicated them in his testimony after his
surrender to Turkish forces.


The defendants rejected the charges but the court in the eastern
city of Malatya found them guilty of "aiding and abetting a
terrorist organisation".


Aytac said they would appeal the sentence, arguing that the PKK
militant who accused them had later retracted his initial
testimony.


The PKK has been waging an armed campaign for self-rule in
Turkey's mainly Kurdish-populated southeast since 1984 in a
conclift which has claimed more than 37,000 lives.


The DTP is frequently accused of supporting the PKK. Several of
its members have been prosecuted for links with the group, which
is listed as a terrorist organisation by Ankara, the European
Union and the United States.
