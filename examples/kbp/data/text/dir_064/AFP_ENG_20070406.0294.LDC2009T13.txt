A suicide bomber exploded a truck full of chlorine near a police
station killing at least 27 people in the restive western city of
Ramadi on Friday, police said.


"At least 27 people, many of them women and children, have been
killed in the attack," said an officer, specifying that another
30 were wounded.


He said the bomber was targeting a police station, but blew
himself up "200 metres (yards) away from it near the residental
area of Al-Tamim."


The explosion occurred next to a market and residential
buildings, he said.


"The truck contained many tonnes of chlorine and TNT which were
covered by sacks full of fertilisers," he said.


A nearby residental building was also partially damaged by the
explosion.


Earlier police Colonel Tark al-Dualiami told AFP that two of the
dead were policemen, adding that at least another two police
officers were wounded.


Ramadi, the provincial capital of the Sunni Anbar province, is a
stronghold of Sunni insurgents and a prime base of Al-Qaeda
operators.


In the past few months, insurgents have been using chlorine bombs
to attack security forces and civilians in the province.
