Five suspected Islamic militants and an Indian army soldier were
killed in three separate gunbattles in revolt-hit Kashmir on
Friday, police said.


Three of the rebel suspects were shot dead Friday during a
shootout with police and troops in summer capital Srinagar,
police officer Pervez Ahmed said.


"Two policemen were also hurt during the gunbattle," he said.


The fighting raged near the shores of Lake Dal as thousands of
Muslims gathered across the water in Hazratbal which houses the
Himalayan region's most revered shrine to offer Friday prayers.


The Hazratbal shrine contains a whisker which Muslims believe
comes from Prophet Mohammed's beard. It is displayed on important
Muslim holidays.


The relic was shown to the worshippers on Friday as the day
marked the Muslim sabbath following the Prophet's birthday.


The gunshot sounds mingled with melodious sufi songs in praise of
the Prophet at Hazratbal.


Meanwhile, an army soldier and a militant were killed in a three-
hour  gunbattle in southern Anantnag district early Friday,
police said, adding another rebel was shot dead during a
gunbattle in Doda district further south.


Kashmir is in the grip of a 17-year-old Islamic separatist
insurgency against Indian rule that has so far left more than
42,000 people dead by official count.


Separatists and militants put the death toll at nearly 100,000.
