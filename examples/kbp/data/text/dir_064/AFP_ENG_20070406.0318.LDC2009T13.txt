Nigerian court workers who launched a strike more than three
weeks ago for better pay have suspended their action, state-run
News Agency of Nigeria reported on Friday.


Members of the Judiciary Staff Association of Nigeria on Thursday
announced the suspension of their strike over improved pay and
welfare conditions, NAN said.


The strike, the second such in two years, was launched to make
state authorities meet workers' demand for better pay and
financial freedom for the judiciary, their officials said.


NAN did not give reasons for the suspension.


The strike paralysed activities at the nation's high courts as
judges and workers remained at home.


There are at least 52 state high court chambers in Lagos' four
judiciary divisions.


State high courts are under state government administrations.
