Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said Friday he was confident
Gaza militants would soon release Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit
and an abducted British journalist, in a French television
interview.


"I would like to say that we are working to secure (soldier
Gilad) Shalit's release and that these efforts will soon bear
fruit. We are optimistic. He will be released soon," Abbas told
the France 24 news channel.


Abbas also said he was "certain" that abducted BBC correspondent
Alan Johnston was alive and would be "released shortly".
