Canterbury Bulldogs outclassed South Sydney 34-10 to end the
Rabbitohs' unbeaten start to Australia's National Rugby League
season on Friday.


South Sydney, winners of their opening three games after
finishing last in 2006, were overpowered by the Bulldogs by five
tries to two before 34,315 fans in the Good Friday match at the
Olympic stadium.


The Bulldogs, led in the forwards by Willie Mason and Reni
Maitua, smashed Souths with their intimidating defence and
bounced back to form after winning just one of their opening
three games.


Winger Hazem El Masri completed his perfect night, which included
three sideline conversions in his seven goals, with a try in the
70th minute after Daryl Millard hurled a pass behind his back as
he was falling in a tackle.


Champions Brisbane Broncos broke through for their first win of
the season and left Sydney Roosters winless after four games with
a comfortable 32-10 victory at the Sydney Football Stadium.


Inspired by skipper Darren Lockyer and centre Justin Hodges, the
Broncos ran in six tries to two.
