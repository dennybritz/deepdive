The chairman of Telecom Italia, Guido Rossi, has resigned amid a
conflict with the main shareholder in the group, the holding
company Olimpia, Ansa news agency and Sky TG24 television said on
Friday.


"Mr Guido Rossi has handed in his resignation from the post of
president and member of the board of governors with immediate
effect," Telecom Italia said in a statement carried by Ansa.


Rossi, who has locked horns with Marco Tronchetti Provera, the
chairman of Italian group Pirelli which owns Olimpia, had said on
several occasions that he might resign.


On Wednesday, Pirelli dropped Rossi from a proposed list of new
directors, which are to be selected on April 16, sparking an open
battle among shareholders.


Pirelli, which controls 18 percent of Telecom Italia, is in
exclusive talks to sell the stake owned by its Olimpia unit in
Telecom Italia to AT&T and its Mexican affiliate America
Movil.
