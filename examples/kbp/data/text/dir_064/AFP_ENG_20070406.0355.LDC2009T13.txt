The United States said Friday it has found a "technical pathway"
to return frozen funds to North Korea, in a development linked to
negotiations over the reclusive state's nuclear program.


"We believe that we have identified a way to do that, but at this
point the US does not have an active role in doing that," said US
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack.
