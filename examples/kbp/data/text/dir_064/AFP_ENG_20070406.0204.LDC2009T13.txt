Former US first lady Betty Ford underwent unspecified treatment
in a Rancho Mirage, California hospital, US media reported
Friday.


The wife of former president Gerald Ford, who died last December,
underwent surgery in the Eisenhower Medical Center in the city in
the southern California Palm Desert area earlier this week and is
now recovering, NBC television said.


Betty Ford, who turns 89 on Sunday, appeared very frail during
the first week in January when she attended a hectic series of
funeral commemorations for her husband, who was president from
1974-1977 after serving as vice president for two years under
Richard Nixon.


He died on December 26 at 93.
