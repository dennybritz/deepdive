Pakistani authorities Friday imposed an indefinite curfew in a
mountainous tribal town bordering Afghanistan after violence
erupted between rival Muslim sects, local officials said.


Soldiers were called out after gunbattles between Sunni and
Shiite Muslims in Parachinar, a town in the semi-autonomous
Kurram region, local administration official Nasim Khan told AFP.


Khan said trouble erupted on Friday when members of the minority
Shiite sect staged a demonstration outside their mosque against
local Sunnis who allegedly chanted anti-Shiite slogans during a
religious rally last week.


Rival groups went on the rampage in the main bazaar and torched a
commercial building and several shops, Khan said. Doctors said 10
people were wounded but exact casualty figures were not
immediately clear.


"Troops have taken up positions in the area and a curfew has been
imposed in the town," he said.


Parachinar, bordering eastern Afghanistan's Paktia province, has
a large Shiite population. Clashes between the two communities
over a local shrine last year left around 20 people dead.


Sectarian violence involving Sunni and Shiite militants has
claimed more than 4,000 lives since the late 1980s. Shiites
account for about 20 percent of Pakistan's 160 million Sunni-
dominated population.


Authorities placed the northwestern Pakistani town of Tank under
curfew last week, after Taliban militants trying to recruit
students to fight in Afghanistan clashed with security forces.
