Dozens of flights were cancelled at Budapest airport Friday, on
the second day of a 48-hour strike by ground staff, the airport
said.


Seventeen incoming and 30 departing flights were cancelled but
the majority were going ahead, despite the strike which started
after salary negotiations between workers and management broke
down on Wednesday.


Airport management originally said 160 flights would have to be
cancelled due to the strike, which began at 1230 GMT on Thursday
and is to end at 1230 GMT on Saturday.


Management urged passengers who had bookings on cancelled flights
-- such as those operated by Lufthansa and British Airways -- to
go to the airport, saying their reservations could be changed to
other airlines.
