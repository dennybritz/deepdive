Two earthquakes, with magnitudes of 4.5 and 4.7, hit central
Japan on Friday in the latest aftershocks following last month's
6.9-magnitude quake, officials said.


The jolts occurred at 3:18 pm (0618 GMT) and 9:42 pm (1242 GMT)
with their epicentres near Wajima on the tip of Noto peninsula,
some 300 kilometres (190 miles) northwest of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency said.


There was no danger of a tsunami resulting from either of the
quakes, the agency said. There was no immediate news on
casualties or damage.


The agency has warned that strong aftershocks were forecast to
continue to strike the region.


The region has been hit by hundreds of aftershocks since the
March 25 quake which killed one person and injured more than 200.


Japan lies at the junction of four tectonic plates and endures
about 20 percent of the world's most powerful earthquakes.
