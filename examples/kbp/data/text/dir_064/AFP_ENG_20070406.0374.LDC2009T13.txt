Partial results from Madagascar's referendum on Friday showed
strong backing for changes to the constitution that would
increase the president's power and make English an official
language.


Some 73.18 percent of voters in more than half of the 17,586
polling stations across the country chose "yes" in Wednesday's
referendum, with a turnout of 42.43 percent, the interior
ministry said.


The opposition claim the main aim of changing the constitution is
to extend the power of the president. The new text contains a
clause allowing the head of state to legislate by decree in
emergency situations.


The changes would also eliminate the autonomy of six provinces,
and make English an official language alongside French and
Malagasy.


President Marc Ravalomanana, who supported the new constitution
and hoped to have 80 percent backing in the referendum, said on
Friday he was "very satisfied" with the preliminary results,
which he said showed his countrymen believe in the changes.


"We will work together, with all the communities and all the
political parties," he told journalists at Antananarivo.


The interior ministry results must still be approved by the
constitutional high court.


In December, Ravalomanana was re-elected president in the first
round with 54.79 percent of the votes, on a 61.93 percent
turnout.


Madagascar's constitution dates back to its independence from
France in 1960 and was last revised in 1998.
