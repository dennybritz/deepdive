The US military said on Friday that no Iranian national had met
five Iranians detained for nearly three months for allegedly
aiding insurgents in Iraq.


On Wednesday, US military spokesman Major General William
Caldwell told reporters that a team from the International
Committee of the Red Cross met the five detained Iranians and
that one of the visitors was "an Iranian."


But on Friday, the military clarified that no Iranian had been in
the ICRC team that visited those held.


"The ICRC committees that visited the five Iranians detained in
Irbil on two occasions did not contain an Iranian national,"
military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver said in
a statement.


"One of the two committees contained an individual who speaks
Farsi and lived in Iran, but he is a British citizen by birth."


On January 11, US troops seized five Iranians from the northern
Iraqi city of Arbil, saying they were suspected of aiding the
insurgency in Iraq.


Since then it has issued no further updates on the condition of
the five who Tehran maintains are diplomats.


Caldwell on Wednesday reiterated that the detainees were not
diplomats, adding they "appeared to be Iranian intelligence
officers."
