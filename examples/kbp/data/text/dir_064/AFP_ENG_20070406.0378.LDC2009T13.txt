Indonesia's human death toll from bird flu has risen to 74 and it
must intensify the fight against the virus after a spate of
fatalities, the country's government said Friday.


There have been 74 deaths from 94 confirmed human infections, a
statement from the National Committee for Avian Influenza Control
and Pandemic Preparedness said, pushing up each number by one.


No further details about the updated toll were released.


"Much has been done in the battle against the deadly virus, but
the war is far from over and we must re-double our efforts this
year," Bayu Krisnamurthi, the committee's chief executive, said.
