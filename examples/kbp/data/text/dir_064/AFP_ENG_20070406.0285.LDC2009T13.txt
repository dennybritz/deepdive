Russian nuclear contractor Atomstroiexport plans to send a
delegation of experts to Iran next week to discuss the completion
of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the company said Friday.


"We plan to send a delegation of experts next week to Tehran to
discuss Bushehr," company spokeswoman Irina Esipova said by
telephone.


The completion of the power station by Atomstroiexport and the
delivery of nuclear fuel by Russia, planned for this year, were
delayed by what Moscow described as financial problems.


Russia had accused Iran of not paying the amounts agreed upon in
a deal reached last September on the construction and nuclear
fuel supply to the plant, but at the end of March, Moscow
acknowledged that Tehran had resumed its payments.


Under the September deal, Russia was to deliver nuclear fuel to
Iran in March, the power station would begin working in September
and it would start producing energy in November.
