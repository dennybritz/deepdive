Consumer prices in Russia rose 0.6 percent in March compared with
the previous month, the Russian Statistics Office said on Friday.


The 12-month inflation figure was at 7.4 percent, in line with
official forecasts of a ceiling of eight percent this year,
central bank president Sergei Ignatiyev, was quoted by the Tass
news agency as saying.


The office said that prices increased by 3.4 percent during the
first quarter of the year, against five percent in the same
period a year earlier.
