Zimbabwe is to set up a new radio station to counter what it
perceives as Western propaganda against veteran President Robert
Mugabe's regime, state media said on Friday.


"We are under siege and being bombarded by the Western media
broadcasting to our people," Information Minister Sikhanyiso
Ndlovu was quoted as saying by ZIANA news agency.


The short wave station, the fifth to be run by the state, will go
on air before April 18 when the country commemorates its 27th
independence anniversary, according to the agency and the daily
Herald.


"There will be a revolutionary development in the media. We
should be able to tell our own story," said Ndlovu after meeting
Iranian diplomats based in Harare.


The new station will cost the cast-strapped country 8.9 billion
Zimbabwe dollars (39.6 million US dollars at the official
exchange rate).


Ndlovu made the announcement after discussing with the Iranian
ambassador to Harare, Rasoul Momeni, a deal to refurbish the
public broadcaster's studios based in the second largest city of
Bulawayo.


Iran has already funded the upgrading of the studios in the
capital.


In the face of growing criticism of his rights record by Western
powers, President Robert Mugabe has in recent years turned to
Tehran and other Eastern countries for friends.
