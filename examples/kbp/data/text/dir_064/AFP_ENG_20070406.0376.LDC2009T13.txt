US President George W. Bush is losing his top day-to-day adviser
on Iraq and Afghanistan, Meghan O'Sullivan, in the coming months,
the White House confirmed Friday.


In a resignation letter to Bush national security adviser Stephen
Hadley, O'Sullivan called her job "appropriately all-consuming"
and expressed optimism that the new US-led security crackdown in
Iraq would pay off.


"After four years -- and now with the policy on new and promising
footing -- I am looking forward to tending to other aspects of my
life," O'Sullivan said in the letter, which the White House
released.


O'Sullivan, 37, did not set a departure date, and the White House
said she stay on for some time. She has been working full-time on
Iraq since the March 2003 US-led invasion.


"Meghan has done a great job. She has served this President with
real distinction during a critical time in Iraq," Hadley said.
"Meghan has shown unfailing commitment and worked hard to
implement the president's vision for a peaceful, stable and
secure Iraq."


Bush's senior national security council director for Iraq, Kevin
Bergner, is going to Baghdad. Brett McGurk, who also works on
Iraq at the national security council, will be acting senior
director in Bergner's absense.
