Hamas's exiled leader Khaled Meshaal vowed Friday that his
organization would continue to resist Israel and would not
compromise its claims to all of historical Palestine.


Speaking from Damascus by telephone, Meshaal addressed thousands
of Hamas supporters who had gathered in the West Bank city of
Ramallah to mark the third anniversary of the deaths of former
Hamas leaders Abdel Aziz Rantissi and Ahmed Yassin, who were
killed by Israel within weeks of each other in 2004.


"Hamas will not back down. We will not give up on a single metre
of our homeland," Meshaal said to thunderous applause.


"We will and we must continue in the path of resistance," he
added.


Earlier this year, in a bid to end a Western-lead aid boycott,
Hamas formed a unity government with the rival Fatah faction
loyal to president Mahmud Abbas.


Israel and the West, however, say they remain unconvinced the new
government meets international demands for acceptance, including
recognising Israel and renouncing violence.


The crippled and charismatic Yassin founded Hamas in 1987 and
remained its spiritual leader until he was killed in an Israeli
air strike on March 22, 2004 after praying in a Gaza City mosque.


Rantissi, his successor, was killed just four weeks later on
April 17, in a second Israeli air strike in Gaza City.
