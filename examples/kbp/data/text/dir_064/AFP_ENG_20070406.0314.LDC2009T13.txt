The 15 British naval personnel detained by Iran were blindfolded,
bound and subjected to "constant psychological pressure", members
of the crew said Friday.


The sailors -- 14 men and one woman -- were told if they did not
admit they had strayed into Iranian waters they faced seven years
in prison, six of the crew told a press conference.


Royal Marine Captain Chris Air said that the only woman among the
group, Faye Turney, was separated from the men straight away and
later told that the men had returned to Britain and she was now
alone in Iran.
