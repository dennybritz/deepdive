Germany's Fraport, the operator of Frankfurt Airport, on Friday
said it has obtained a 24.5-percent stake in the international
airport in the northwestern Chinese city of Xi'an.


Fraport said it had paid some 50 million euros (67 million
dollars) for its share in Xianyang International Airport, thereby
becoming the first foreign operator to obtain an interest in an
unlisted Chinese airport.


"This makes us pioneers in this important area and I believe we
will enjoy great success," Fraport chairman Wilhelm Bender said
in a statement.


The state-owned company China West Airport Group has until now
been the sole owner of the airport in Xi'an, a city of more than
seven million people.


Bender said the deal would mark the start of a Fraport investment
drive in China.


In 2006, some 9.4 million people passed through Xianyang
International Airport and Fraport said the figure was expected to
increase to 11 million this year.


The Civil Aviation Administration of China estimates that by 2010
there will be an annual passenger volume of 500 million people
through China's airports. ef/jmy
