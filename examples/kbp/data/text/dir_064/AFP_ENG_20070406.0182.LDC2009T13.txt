A leading composite indicator for the 30-member Organisation of
Economic Cooperation and Development was stable in February at
109.5 points, but signs pointed to softer economic conditions
further down the line, the OECD said Friday.


The six-month variable composite leading indicator (CLI) which
the OECD takes as an important guide to future economic
conditions has shown an easing trend since March 2006, the
organisation said.


"February 2007 data show weakening performance in the CLI's six-
month rate of change in most of the major seven economies," it
added.


The CLI is meant to give "early signals of turning points between
expansions and slowdowns of economic activity."


The OECD is an international economics institution that counts
most of the world's most industrialised countries as members.
