No continent is likely to escape adverse effects from climate
change if global temperatures rise more than 2-3 C (3.6-5.4 F)
compared to 1990 levels, a UN climate report said Friday.


"It is very likely that all regions will experience either
declines in benefits or increases in costs for increases in
temperature greater than 2 to 3 degrees" (C), or 3.6-5.4 F,
according to a summary for policymakers approved by the UN's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).


The final text was toned down from an earlier draft that said
this worldwide impact would happen if the temperature rise was
"greater than 2 degrees" (3.6 F).
