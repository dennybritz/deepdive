Iran used the only woman among 15 British naval personnel as a
"propaganda tool", keeping her isolated and telling her she was
the only one being held, the group said Friday.


In a joint statement read at a news conference, her colleagues
said they were "incredibly proud" of Leading Seaman Faye Turney,
26, and the "highly professional" way she conducted herself
throughout the 13-day detention.


"The fact that she's a woman has been used as a propaganda tool
by Iran. This is deeply regrettable," they said.
