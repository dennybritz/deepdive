Iran used the only woman among 15 captured British naval
personnel as a "propaganda tool", keeping her isolated and
telling her she was the only one being held, the group said
Friday.


In a joint statement read at a news conference, her colleagues
said they were "incredibly proud" of Leading Seaman Faye Turney,
26, and the "highly professional" way she conducted herself
throughout their 13-day detention.


"The fact that she's a woman has been used as a propaganda tool
by Iran. This is deeply regrettable," they said.


In a question and answer session afterwards, they said the
mother-of-one had been separated and isolated soon after their
detention near the Shatt al-Arab waterway dividing Iraq and Iran
on March 23.


"She was told shortly afterwards that we had all been released.
She was under the impression for about four days that she was the
only one there," Royal Marine Captain Chris Air said.


"She was subject to quite a lot of stress that we don't know
about. She coped admirably, retaining a lot of dignity."


Turney, who is married to a Royal Navy petty officer, was not
present at the press conference.
