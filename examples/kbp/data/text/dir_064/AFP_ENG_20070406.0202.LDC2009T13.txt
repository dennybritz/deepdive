Sri Lanka's move to cut food prices ahead of the traditional New
Year has unwittingly made exotic caviar cheaper in a country
where more than half the population earn less than a dollar a
day.


Sri Lanka marks the traditional Sinhala and Tamil New Year next
weekend and prices usually soar during the festive season.


Trade minister Bandula Gunawardena said on Friday that import
duties were lifted indefinitely from seven essential commodities.


Caviar qualified to be a duty-free import as it is clubbed under
government regulations with canned tuna and sardines that are
popular among consumers and considered essential commodities,
Gunawardena said.


"I hope only a small quantity of caviar will be imported because
only five-star hotels buy it," the minister said.


Other items excluded from import tax were chillies, lentils and
dried fish.


Sri Lanka's inflation rate is running at about 19.5 precent.


About half of the country's 19.5 million population earn less
than a dollar a day.
