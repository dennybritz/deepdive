Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has ordered that officers of
Saddam Hussein's dissolved armed forces get back either their job
or their pension, his office said on Friday.


The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on March 20, a
statement said, in the latest bid to wean members of the ousted
regime away from the persistent Sunni Arab insurgency.


All officers with the rank of lieutenant colonel or above will be
offered a pension.


Those with the rank of major or below will be absorbed into the
the armed forces of the US-backed government or into government
ministries.


The decree reversed one of the most widely criticised decisions
of the US-led occupation, which saw all of Saddam Hussein's
soldiers and civil servants above a certain rank stripped of
their employment in June 2003.


The dismantlement of a military establishment which employed some
300,000 people, many of them Sunnis, has been widely blamed for
the virulence of the violence facing US and Iraqi troops.


In a bid to win over the insurgents to the political mainstream,
the US-backed Maliki government has been reaching out to former
officers in a bid to promote a national reconciliation programme
first unveiled last June.


Late last month, the prime minister's office announced that a
revised de- Baathification law had been forwarded to cabinet and
parliament for approval.


If approved, the new law would pave the way for government
departments to restore the jobs of some former Baathists.


The law has yet to reach parliament, however, amid reports that a
number of Shiite and Kurdish MPs are opposed to it.
