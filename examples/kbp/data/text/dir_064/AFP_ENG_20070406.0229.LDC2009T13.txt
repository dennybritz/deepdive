Car sales in Vietnam doubled in the first quarter of the year,
the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers' Association (VAMA) said
Friday.


Large gains from the country's booming stock market drove the
growth, a VAMA official said, which reported a total of 12,183
vehicles sold between January and March, compared to last year's
figure for the same period of of 6,091.


Leading the surge were passenger cars, up by 235 percent, from
829 units in the three-month period last year to 2,774 this year.


For the month of March alone, car sales were up 91 percent year-
on-year, from 2,334 to 4,469 units, the association said.


"Many people who earned huge money from trading securities
ordered cars in January before the Tet traditional lunar new year
festival, and they could only receive their cars this month," a
VAMA official told AFP.


Ho Chi Minh City's benchmark VN Index has outperformed every
other bourse in Asia, with a growth of nearly 145 percent last
year and about 40 percent this year.


VAMA has 18 members, of which 11 are foreign funded.
