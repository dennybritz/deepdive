Challengers to Alinghi's America's Cup crown caught a glimpse of
what they were up against when the Swiss  champions won Friday's
4th regatta in final preliminary heats staged here for the Louis-
Vuitton Cup.


Alinghi, who had already won Wednesday's 2nd and 3rd regattas of
Act 13, took 12 points as they won in 1hr 15min 5sec ahead of
Italian boats Mascalzone Latino, at 1min 7sec, and Luna Rossa, at
1:24.


There was disappointment for the +39 Challenge team who did not
start on Friday after their new mast came crashing down in
Wednesday's action.


Emirates Team New Zealand won the 5th regatta later in the day
ahead of Luna Rossa and Alinghi. Alinghi lead overall with two
regattas still to go.


Act 13 is the final preliminary leg in which Alinghi's 11
challengers gain bonus points ahead of the Louis Vuitton Cup
(April 16-May 7).


The Louis-Vuitton winner earns the right to take on Alinghi, who
defend the title they won in Auckland Bay in New Zealand four
years ago, in the 32nd America's Cup best-of-nine race match in
June.
