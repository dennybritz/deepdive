Up to 30 percent of animal and plant species will be vulnerable
to extinction if global temperatures rise by 1.5-2.5 C (2.7 F to
4.5 F), UN climate experts said in a key report here on Friday.


The warning was spelt out in a report by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN's top expert authority on
global warming.


The report predicted greenhouse gases would change rainfall
patterns, intensify tropical storms, accelerate the melting of
Arctic ice and mountain glaciers, and amplify the risk of
drought, flooding and water stress.
