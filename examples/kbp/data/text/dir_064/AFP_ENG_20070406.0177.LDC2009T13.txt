Luigi Comencini, one of Italy's best known and prolific film
directors, has died at age 90, the Lucherini film studios
announced Friday.


Comencini was best known for his 1953 hit, "Bread, Love and
Dreams", which starred Gina Lollobrigida and Vittorio De Sica and
spawned two sequels.


But he considered "La Storia" with Claudia Cardinale to be his
best film.


Comencini directed 50 movies -- including "Traffic Jam" in 1979
and "Misunderstood" in 1966 -- many of which focused on the
plight of children and the working man. Comencini also wrote
about 40 screenplays.


He paired the American actress Bette Davis with Alberto Sordi in
the semi-black comedy "The Millionairess" in 1972.


Born in 1916 in the northern Italian province of Brescia,
Comencini studied in Paris and at the Milan school of
architecture. He was a cinema critic before launching his career
as a director in 1946 with "Children in Cities".


Comencini retired from the cinema in 1989. His daughter Cristina
picked up the baton, becoming a director herself.
