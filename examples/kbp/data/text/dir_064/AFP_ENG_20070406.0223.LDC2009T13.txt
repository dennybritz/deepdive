Men in a remote Indian village plagued by drinking water problems
are hoping they will now be able to lure brides thanks to a new
well, a report said Friday.


Badwan village in Bihar state got its first hand-pumped well last
month, sparing villagers a five-kilometre (three-mile) trek to
get water in blazing heat, the Hindustan Times newspaper
reported.


Residents in neighbouring villages were reluctant to allow their
daughters to marry men from Badwan because they did not want them
to have to undertake the daily walk for water, priest Madan
Mishra told the daily.


Unmarried men in the village also blamed their bachelor status on
the village's water woes, resident Brirendra Yadav said.


Engineer A.P. Ranjan said he took the step to install the pump
after hearing the villagers' complaints.
