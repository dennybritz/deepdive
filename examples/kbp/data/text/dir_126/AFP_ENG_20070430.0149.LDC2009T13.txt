Five would-be suicide bombers linked to a group which carried out
car-bomb attacks which killed 30 people here on April 11 have
been arrested, a newspaper reported.


The El Khabar daily reported that one of the five, identified
only as Mustapha, was arrested on April 12 and had confessed to
police to having taken part in planning for suicide attacks in
Algiers.


Police were not available to comment on the report.


The suspects were reportedly members of the Salafist Group for
Preaching and Combat, which recently changed its name to Al-
Qaeda's branch in North Africa.


Suicide car bomb attacks claimed by the Al-Qaeda affiliate rocked
the Algerian capital including the prime minister's office on
April 11, killing 30 people and injuring more than 200.
