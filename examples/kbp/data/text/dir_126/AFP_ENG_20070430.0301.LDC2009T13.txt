A Soviet war memorial that was removed from the centre of Tallinn
last week was Monday re-positioned in a military cemetery in the
Estonian capital, an AFP correspondent reported.


The 2.5-metre (eight-feet) tall bronze statue was hoisted onto a
specially laid foundation at around 4:00 pm (1300 GMT).


An official ceremony will be held on May 8 to inaugurate the
statue in its new site, the defence ministry has said.
