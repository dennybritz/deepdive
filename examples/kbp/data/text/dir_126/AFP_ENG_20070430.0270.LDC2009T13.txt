Almost five percent of deaths and disease are caused by household
air pollution in 21 mainly African countries, and could be easily
prevented by switching fuels, the World Health Organisation said
Monday.


The health risks could be eliminated and some 1.5 million lives
saved if people in the world's poorest countries were able to
give up solid fuels, the WHO said in a statement.


Reliance on solid fuels and indoor air pollution is rated as one
of the 10 most important threats to public health, causing
pneumonia and crippling respiratory disease.


About three billion people depend on wood, dung, crop residues
and coal for cooking and heating.


"The prevention potential is enormous," said WHO Assistant
Director-General Susanne Weber-Mosdorf.


"Solutions are available, and it is our international
responsibility to promote the health and well-being of those
affected, who are mostly women and children," she added.


The WHO is calling for a shift towards cleaner and more efficient
modern fuels, such as biogas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and
kerosene as well as improved cooking stoves, and smoke hoods to
cut indoor household pollution.


The data was released as ministers met during the United Nations
Commission on Sustainable Development in New York, to decide on
measures against indoor air pollution.


The 21 worst-affected countries include 20 in sub-Saharan Africa
and Pakistan. Last year, the WHO estimated that the death toll
from "the killer in the kitchen" included 800,000 children and
500,000 women.
