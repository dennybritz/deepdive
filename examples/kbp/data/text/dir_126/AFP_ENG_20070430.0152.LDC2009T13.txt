Five men, including one who boasted of working for the number
three in Al-Qaeda, were found guilty Monday of plotting a series
of deadly bomb attacks on British targets.


The men were among seven alleged to have conspired to cause
explosions at a central London nightclub and shopping centre, as
well as hit gas and electricity supplies using bombs made from
chemical fertiliser.


One also discussed trying to buy a radioactive "dirty bomb" from
the Russian mafia but nothing appeared to have come from his
enquiries, the year-long trial at London's Central Criminal Court
was told.


They were arrested on March 30, 2004 after more than half a ton
of fertiliser was discovered in a storage facility in west
London.


The jury began deliberating its verdicts on March 16 but has not
sat every day. The guilty decision came on the 27th day of
discussions.
