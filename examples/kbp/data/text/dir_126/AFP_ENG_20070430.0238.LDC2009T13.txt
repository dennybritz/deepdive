Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday received a copy of a
critical inquiry into last year's war against Hezbollah from
members of the commission probing the conflict, his office said.


Retired Judge Eliahu Winograd and the four other members of the
commission arrived at Olmert's Jerusalem office to hand him a
copy of the partial report, before they present the interim
findings at a press conference at 1400 GMT.
