The US Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a case brought by
two detainees at the US prison in Guantanamo Bay, who were
contesting the legality of the base's military courts.


The court did not give any reason for refusing to hear the case,
but said three of the nine judges had been in favor of proceeding
with the hearing.


Yemeni national Salim Ahmed Hamdan and Canadian Omar Khadr had
asked if they had the rights to defense set out in the US
constitution.
