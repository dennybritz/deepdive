Pakistan said Monday a weekend suicide bombing that killed 29
people appeared to be "backlash" for the country's campaign
against Al-Qaeda militants.


Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao told a news conference Saturday's
bombing in Charsada in northwest Pakistan was meant to kill him.


The bomber blew himself up at a public rally addressed by the
minister, who was injured along with more than 50 people.


Pakistan has arrested more than 700 Al-Qaeda fugitives, who fled
to the country after the fall of hardline Taliban regime in
neighbouring Afghanistan.


"We have carried out operations against militants, Al-Qaeda which
came to Pakistan after 9/11," Sherpao said.


"When you marginalise and pressurise these elements they
naturally retaliate. These are some of the backlashes of the war
on terror," the minister said.


Pakistan has been rocked by a series of suicide bombings and
terror attacks -- which have killed scores of people -- since the
beginning of this year.


The government has blamed the previous attacks on pro-Al-Qaeda
militants hiding in the country's lawless tribal areas bordering
Afghanistan.


Pakistani forces have killed more than 1,000 Islamic militants
and lost 700 soldiers in battles with the extremists over recent
years.


Sherpao said Russian-made explosives were used by the suicide
bomber in the Charsada attack.


Authorities found the severed head of the bomber and DNA tests
were being conducted on his remains.


Shops were shut in Charsada and three days of mourning were
announced in protest at the bombing.
