And Gomersall, a World Cup winner with England in 2003, has
signed a new two- year contract to stay with Harlequins until
June 2009.


The 32-year-old scrum-half joined Quins from Worcester in
September and helped them finish a creditable seventh in the
Premiership.


"I'm looking forward to a bright future at Quins," said
Gomersall, who has been tipped for an England recall for the
summer tour to South Africa.


Director of rugby Dean Richards said: "Andy's skill and
experience in such a key position is exactly what you need in the
Premiership."
