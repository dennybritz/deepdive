Hard-left activists in Ukraine demonstrated Monday outside the
Estonian embassy over the removal of a controversial Soviet war
memorial from the Estonian capital Tallinn.


Several dozen people, mostly Communists and pensioners, shouted
"Fascism will not pass!" outside the building in Kiev, Interfax
news agency reported. They also threw eggs and paint balloons.


Two were detained after scuffles with police, an interior
ministry spokesman told AFP.


Estonian authorities have removed a Soviet war memorial from a
central square in Tallinn, sparking a furious Russian reaction.


Estonians see the statue as a reminder of 50 years of Soviet
occupation following World War II and are moving the so-called
"Bronze Soldier" to the less central military cemetery in the
capital.


Russia says the statue should stay where it is.
