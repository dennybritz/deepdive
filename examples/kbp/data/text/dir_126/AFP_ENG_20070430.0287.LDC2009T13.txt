Three civil guards were among 39 people arrested during a police
operation against smugglers working out of Spanish fishing ports,
which netted nearly 20 tonnes of hashish, police said Monday.


Operation Mamola, which was launched last spring, dismantled five
smuggling rings using fishing boats to bring drugs into various
ports along the southeastern Spanish coastal region of Almeria,
said a police statement.


Last July, officers seized more than eight tonnes of hashish from
a fishing boat in one raid.


Another raid a month later, police netted 9.4 tonnes of hashish
as it was being loaded on to a truck at a port in Almeria.


Police suspect the three arrested civil guards were covering up
the drug trafficking.


Of the 39 arrested, 32 were Spanish citizens, three Moroccan, two
Ukrainian, one Russian and one an Italian citizen. The groups is
thought to have been importing the drugs from north Africa.
