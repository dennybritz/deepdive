The Sudanese army said on Monday that it was searching for one of
its helicopters it said has been missing since being forced to
make an emergency landing in the troubled Darfur region.


According to a statement by the military, the helicopter was on a
reconnaissance mission when the pilot reported mechanical
problems by radio.


"We lost contact with him," the statement said, adding that a
search and rescue operation was launched to locate the pilot and
the co-pilot.


Some of the Darfur rebel groups that did not endorse the 2006
peace agreement with Khartoum claimed the helicopter was shot
down while bombarding targets in North Darfur.


Rebel commander Salah Bob told the Akhbar al-Yom newspaper that
his men had captured the pilot, and condemned what he described
as a relentless aerial campaign by the Sudanese army.


The Khartoum goverment announced a week ago that it would refrain
from carrying out military operations in Darfur for two months in
order to allow for holdout rebel factions to join the peace
process.


According to the United Nations, at least 200,000 people have
been killed and more than two million displaced since the
conflict erupted in Darfur more than four years ago. Some sources
say the toll is much higher.


A peace agreement was signed in May 2006 with the Sudanese
government, but only one of three negotiating rebel factions
endorsed the deal. The violence has since spiralled and rebel
splinters have flourished.
