Nigeria's inflation rate dropped to 7.2 percent in the 12 months
ending March 2007 from 7.7 percent in the preceding month, the
National Bureau of Statistics said Monday.


"The composite consumer price index stood at 159.2 in March 2007.
This represented an increase of 1.0 percent from the 157.6
observed in February 2007," the agency said.


It said the increase in the index was caused mainly by a rise in
the price of some food items, household goods and services.


Nigerian inflation has been falling steadily since the third
quarter of last year as a result of the government's tight fiscal
and monetary policies.


Nigeria, Africa's biggest producer of crude oil, is the sixth-
largest exporter in the world, acccounting for a daily output of
around 2.6 million barrels, a quarter of which is currently lost
to unrest in the volatile Niger Delta.


The Niger Delta is home to the country's multi-billion-dollar oil
industry, but the majority of its inhabitants live on less than
one dollar a day, fanning unrest for a fair deal.
