A South African national has been arrested in Zambia for
allegedly insulting and making disparaging remarks about
President Levy Mwanawasa to fellow miners, an official said
Monday.


Brandon Childs, 22, was arrested last week after some Zambians he
was working with at the Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) reported him to
the police for allegedly defaming the president, a district
commissioner Dyford Muulwa said.


"He was arrested and charged with an offence of defaming the
president," Muulwa said.


The nature of the insults against Mwanawasa have not been
disclosed.


Childs, who works for RJ Southey, a South African firm contracted
by MCM, has since been released on police bail awaiting
instructions from the director of public prosecutions to decide
on the next course of action.


Defaming the head of state in Zambia is a criminal offence that
can carry a maximum jail sentence of three years.


A British national was early this year deported from Zambia after
he insulted Mwanawasa while another Briton, a newspaper
columnist, is awaiting his fate in the Supreme Court after the
government tried to have him kicked out for insulting the
president in an article.
