US President George W. Bush views Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert as "essential" to Middle East peace efforts, the White
House said Monday as Olmert faced tough criticism over the
Lebanon war.


Bush "works very closely with prime minister Olmert and thinks
that he's essential in working toward a two-state solution. The
president remains committed to it," said spokesman Tony Snow.
