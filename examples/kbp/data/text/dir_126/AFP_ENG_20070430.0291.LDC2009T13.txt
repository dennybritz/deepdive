More than a third of British homosexuals who are infected with
the AIDS virus continue to have unprotected sex, according to a
survey published on Tuesday.


The investigation was carried out in 2003 and 2004 among 2,640
men in London, Manchester and Brighton who filled out
questionnaires.


Most of the volunteers also provided a saliva sample for HIV
testing, and the results showed that among those with the AIDS
virus, only a third knew they had been infected.


Thirty-seven percent of HIV-positive men said they had had
unprotected sex with more than one partner in the past year,
while the rate among HIV-negative men was 18 percent.


The survey appears in the latest issue of the journal Sexually
Transmitted Infections, published by the British Medical
Association (BMA).


The authors, led by Julie Dodds of the Centre for Sexual Health
and HIV Research at University College London, say they are
worried.


The high rates of unsafe sex and ignorance about HIV status
occurred despite an awareness campaign and access to condoms,
virus testing and antiretroviral drugs, they note.
