German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse said Monday it
planned to bid 2.8 billion dollars (2.1 billion euros) for US
market International Securities Exchange, the world leader in
stock options.


The German group, which has failed in attempts to buy the London
Stock Exchange and pan-European operator Euronext in recent
years, said it would bid 67.50 dollars per share in cash via its
subsidiary Eurex, a joint company with Swiss partner SWX.
