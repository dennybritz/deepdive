Low-frequency electromagnetic fields do not pose a cancer hazard
to electricity workers, according to a wide-scale study that will
be published on Tuesday.


The study looked at the health and employment records of 28,000
workers in electricity supply companies in Denmark, in a database
going back to 1968.


Ill health and mortality among these workers were compared with
the Danish Cancer Registry, where all new cases of cancer have
been filed since 1942.


The researchers say they find no evidence to suggest that
exposure to low- frequency electromagnetic fields boosted the
risk of leukaemia, brain cancer and breast cancer, as some lab
studies have contended.


The paper appears in Occupational and Environmental Medicine, a
journal published by the British Medical Association (BMA).


Its authors, led by Christoffer Johansen of the Institute of
Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen, say there is no need to
tighten international safety guidelines on occupational exposure
to these fields, which have a frequency of 50-60 Herz.


A review of evidence, carried out in 2002 by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer, came to the same conclusion.
