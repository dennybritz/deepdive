Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels said Monday that they hit a
military war plane on a bombing mission over their territory with
anti-aircraft fire.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said they attacked
the Israeli-built Kfir jet Monday as it flew over the rebel-held
Kilinochchi district, but that the aircraft was not shot down.


"Our anti-aircraft unit confirms attacking a Kfir jet over
Kilinochchi," the rebel's spokesman, Rasiah Ilanthiriyan, said by
telephone from the area, which lies 330 kilometres (206 miles)
north of the capital, Colombo.


"The aircraft did not fall within our territory," he said.


But the Sri Lankan military denied that an aircraft had been hit.
It said all military aircraft were safe.


"Tamil Tigers had dreamt of a Sri Lankan air force Kfir jet being
shot over Iranamadu (in Kilinochchi district)," the defence
ministry said in a statement.


Sri Lankan jets have been bombing inside rebel-held territory on
a regular basis since April last year.


The rebels have launched their own air attacks recently, using
light aircraft to bomb military and civilian targets over the
last month.


The rebels say they are fighting for an independent homeland for
Sri Lanka's minority Tamil community.


The conflict has killed more than 60,000 people over some three
decades.
