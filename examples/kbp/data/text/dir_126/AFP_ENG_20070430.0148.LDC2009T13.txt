International air travel continued to accelerate in March,
driving the airline industry to its first overall profit for more
than six years, the top airline association said Monday.


Passenger travel rose by 7.8 percent year-on-year in March and by
7.0 percent in the first quarter of 2007 thanks to the strength
of major economies, the International Air Transport Association
(IATA) said in a statement.


The growth in March was the strongest monthly figure recorded
over the past year, it added.


"People want to travel and they are doing it in record numbers,"
said IATA Director General Giovanni Bisignani.


"The fact that airlines are meeting that demand with newer, more
fuel-efficient aircraft and near-record load factors bodes well
for the bottom line and should lead to an industry profit of 3.8
billion dollars in 2007," he added.


However, air freight lagged well behind, growing by just 2.3
percent in March and by 2.7 percent for the first three months of
the year.


"The story for passenger traffic is based on strong economies
driving the demand to travel for both business and leisure
markets," Bisignani said.


"For freight, competition for other modes of transport --
particularly sea -- is holding growth below our forecast of 5.5
percent for 2007," he added.


IATA, which groups more than 260 airlines, had signalled two
years ago that the industry was expected to break even by 2007.
But it sharply increased its average profit forecast from 2.5
billion dollars at the beginning of April.
