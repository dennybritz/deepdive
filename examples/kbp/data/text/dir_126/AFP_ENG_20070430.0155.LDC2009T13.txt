Presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Pervez Musharraf of
Pakistan agreed Monday to establish a joint committee with Turkey
in a bid to boost confidence between the two troubled neighbours,
they said in a joint declaration after talks here.


The two leaders pledged "to initiate immediate action on specific
intelligence exchanges" as part of their commitment to "deny
sanctuary, training and financing to terrorists and to elements
involved in subversive and anti-state activities in each other's
countries," the statement said.


They agreed to hold another round of talks in Turkey in either
late 2007 or early 2008, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
told reporters.


Monday's talks, the first between Karzai and Musharraf since
September, aimed at easing bilateral tensions over the fight
against the Taliban militia, which Kabul accuses Islamabad of
tacitly supporting.
