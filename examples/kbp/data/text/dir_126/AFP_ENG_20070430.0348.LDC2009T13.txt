Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon was in Washington
Monday for two days of talks with top US diplomats on nuclear
energy cooperation, the Indian embassy said.


US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United
States would like to rapidly finalize a civilian nuclear deal.


"We will get this deal done," McCormack said. "I think the
meetings coming up over the next couple of weeks will give us a
good indication of how quickly a deal can get done."


He added the United States was interested in "what sort of ideas
the Indian government comes to the table with," on the issue.


The talks have stalled mainly over concerns in India that the
agreement will seek to curtail the country's nuclear weapons
program.


An embassy press spokesman confirmed to AFP that Menon had
arrived in Washington on Sunday, but would not give any further
statement.


During his two-day visit, Menon is to meet with US Under
Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns and Paula
Dobriansky, US under secretary of state for global affairs and
democracy.


The talks are to implement an accord struck in July 2005 giving
India access to US nuclear fuel and technology for civilian use
without requiring New Delhi to sign the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty as required by US law.


But differences persist, chiefly over a clause which states the
US would withdraw civil nuclear fuel supplies and equipment if
India breaches its unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.
