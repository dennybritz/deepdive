The UN Security Council Monday urged Morocco and the separatist
Polisario Front to launch direct, UN-sponsored talks without
preconditions on self-determination in the disputed Western
Sahara.


The 15-member body unanimously adopted a resolution that also
took note of the two parties' rival plans to settle their 32
-year-old dispute and renewed the mandate of the UN Mission for
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for another six
months.
