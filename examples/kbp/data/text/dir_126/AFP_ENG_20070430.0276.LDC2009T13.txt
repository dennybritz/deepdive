Ukrainian police firing tear gas broke up a demonstration in
front of the Estonian embassy in Kiev Monday that protested the
controversial removal of a Soviet-era war memorial in Tallinn.


Several dozen Ukrainians, many of them past retirement age,
shouted "Fascism will not pass!" the Interfax agency reported.


They threw eggs and balloons filled with paint at the diplomatic
mission and posted stickers showing the Estonian flag with a
swastika on it.


Police fired tear gas against the demonstrators, the interior
ministry said, according to Interfax.


The two most active protesters were briefly arrested, questioned
on site and then released, ministry spokesman Kostyantin Stogny,
told AFP. No-one had been hurt, he added but the two men arrested
would face charges fo "hooliganism".


The protest was sparked by the removal last week of a statue in
the Estonian capital Tallinn that commemorated the deaths of
Soviet Red Army soldiers in World War II.


Riots broke out in Tallinn following the monument's removal,
leaving one Russian man dead and more than 150 people injured.


The removal of the statue and the accompanying violence has
caused a diplomatic crisis between Estonia and Russia.


For many Estonians the statue is a painful reminder of 50 years
of Soviet occupation.


Russians, including the substantial Russian minority in Estonia,
see it as a sacred memorial to millions of Red Army soldiers who
died fighting the Nazis.


The Estonian defence ministry has said the statue will be re-
erected in a military cemetery later Monday.
