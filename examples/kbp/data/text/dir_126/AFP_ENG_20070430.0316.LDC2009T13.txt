A Democratic Republic of Congo opposition figure accused of
leading an insurrection was Monday cleared of the charges along
with nine other defendants by a military tribunal here.


The case against Marie-Therese N'Landu Nene, her driver, her
press attache and the other co-accused was not established, the
head of the court, Major Mboloko Ewawa, declared at the end of
the four-month-long trial.


"In consequence, the tribunal... acquits the accused and orders
the return of their assets that were seized," notably a car and
telephones, he said.


N'Landu Nene, a former presidential candidate in last year's
elections, had been charged after a November 2006 demonstration
she attended ended with a fire being set in Kinshasa's Supreme
Court building.
