Greece is preparing to host military exercises from May 7 to 19
with a new battle group that includes Bulgaria, Cyprus and
Romania, its general staff announced Monday.


After map-based exercise for the first five days, 1,200 soldiers
and police officers will take part in the manoeuvres in the
northern Askos region.


The Evrop II-07 exercise is designed to test the participants'
readiness to handle humanitarian operations including the
evacuation of the civilian population.


The HELBROC battle group that unites the countries was drawn up
under the auspices of a European Union initiative to create
relatively small forces that can deploy rapidly to deal with
crises.
