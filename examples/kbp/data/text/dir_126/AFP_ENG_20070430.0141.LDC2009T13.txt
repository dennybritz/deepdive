Aspiring to be a common worker is no longer high on the wish list
of Chinese children, state press reported Monday, citing a recent
Shanghai government survey.


Only 0.1 percent of all children in China's wealthy financial
hub, dream of becoming a simple labourer, the People's Daily
reported on its website.


The result is a far cry from China communist heyday in the 1960s
when the nation was still in the throes of revolution, and
becoming a worker was the fervent ambition of many.


For decades after the communists came into power in 1949,
workers, peasants and soldiers were held up as the three main
pillars of China's "new" society.


Workers were looked upon with respect and used to enjoy cradle-
to-grave social welfare.


But today, after nearly 30 years of top-to-bottom market economy
reforms, joining the toiling masses is apparently an aspiration
of a by-gone era.


Most of today's Chinese labour force is composed of lowly paid
migrant workers struggling to make ends meet.


"Nobody wants to be blue collar if one can get a white collar
job," said Li Rong, a vocational school graduate who works in
human resources, adding that she thought the number who actually
wanted such a job was probably less than 0.1 percent.
