Heatstroke has killed three people in India's desert state of
Rajasthan, police said Monday.


The temperature in one desert town reached 46 degrees Celsius
(114.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, they said.


High temperatures have killed at least three other people since
the onset of a harsh summer over northern India in mid-April.


The weather department reported "severe heatwave conditions" in
states such as Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, the United News of
India said.


The temperature in the capital New Delhi reached 42 degrees
Celsius.


Tens of thousands of people have taken to sleeping outside at
night across India as power shortages turn off fans and air
conditioners.


Authorities in the southern state of Karnataka rushed emergency
supplies of water to towns and villages Monday as the heatwave
took its toll in the region, parts of which face a crippling
drought, the Press Trust of India said.
