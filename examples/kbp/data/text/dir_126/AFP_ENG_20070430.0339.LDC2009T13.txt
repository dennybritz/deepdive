Experienced Irish referee Alan Lewis is to referee the European
Cup final, it was announced on Monday.


The 42-year-old will be refereeing his third European final - the
other two being Challenge Cup finals in 2002 and 2005 - when he
takes charge of the May 20 showpiece between English sides Wasps
and Leicester at Twickenham.


"It is an absolute privilege to be entrusted with the European
Cup final," said Lewis, who is also among the 12 referees due to
officiate at the World Cup beginning in September.


"The final promises to be a very special occasion between two
English teams for whom I have the greatest respect, being played
at their national ground.


"I have refereed both clubs twice this year - Leicester in the
European Cup quarter-finals and at Twickenham in the final of the
EDF Energy Cup and Wasps in two European Cup matches," added
Lewis, who has refereed a record 44 European matches.


Welshman Nigel Owens - who is also due to referee at the World
Cup - has been handed responsibility for the European Challenge
Cup between French side Clermont and English outfit Bath which is
at Harlequins ground The Stoop on May 19.
