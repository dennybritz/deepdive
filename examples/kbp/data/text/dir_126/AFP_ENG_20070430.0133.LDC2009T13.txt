A suicide bomber exploded near a US-owned private security firm's
vehicle in southern Afghanistan Monday, killing one local guard
and injuring three others, police said.


The attack by a motorcycle-riding bomber just outside the
violence-hit Kandahar city was the second suicide bombing
targeting the same company -- US Protection and Investigation
(USPI)-- this month.


"There was a suicide bombing carried out by a motorcyclist
against a USPI vehicle. One Afghan guard was killed and three
others were injured," Kandahar police chief, Esmatullah Alizai
said.


The attack in the Zhiri district was the latest in a wave of
Iraq-style suicide bombing rocking Afghanistan in recent weeks.


On April 15, four Afghan employees were killed when a suicide
bomber targeted the USPI vehicle on a road near the Kandahar Air
Base, housing  thousands of NATO-led troops.


A day later nine Afghan police men were killed when a suicide
bomber exploded a bomb strapped to his body in the northeastern
city of Kunduz.


The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.


There were no claims for Monday's attack but similar incidents
have in the past been either blamed on Taliban or claimed by the
rebels.


They have been targeting Afghan and foreign troops but also aid
and construction workers or Afghans working with foreign
companies or humanitarian groups.
