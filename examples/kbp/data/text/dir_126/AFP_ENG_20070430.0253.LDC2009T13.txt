A British judge on Monday handed down a life prison sentence to
the ringleader of a group of five militants found guilty of
plotting a series of deadly bomb attacks in Britain.


Omar Khyam, who claimed to have links with Al-Qaeda's number
three and also had ties with two of the suicide bombers who
attacked London in July 2005, was ordered to serve at least 40
years in jail.


"You have betrayed this country that has given you every
opportunity," said judge Sir Michael Astill.
