A court in Sweden ordered a university on Monday to pay several
thousand of dollars in damages to three women refused admission
in favour of male students with lower grades.


The court ruled that Oerebro University in central Sweden was
guilty of gender discrimination and must pay each of the women
75,000 kronor (11,145 dollars, 8,190 euros) in damages and cover
their court costs.


The university was not however required to grant the women
admission.


The three women, now aged 23, 23, and 21, had applied to the
school's Health Promotion programme in 2005, but were denied
admission. Three men who had lower grades were admitted.


University officials told the Oerebro district court that it had
applied affirmative action rules because it wanted to increase
the number of male students in the programme as men were
underrepresented.


But the court ruled that the university had discriminated against
the women, as affirmative action rules only allow the university
to admit the men instead of the women if they all had similar
grades.


The university has not yet decided whether it will appeal the
verdict, according to Swedish news agency TT.


The Swedish government has allowed universities to apply
affirmative action since 2003. About 60 percent of university
students in Sweden are women.
