Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived in the Gulf state of
Kuwait on Monday on the third leg of a Middle East tour aimed at
strengthening economic ties with the oil-rich region.


Abe has already visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
on his five- day tour, and is expected to travel on to Qatar and
Egypt.


Japan is increasingly concerned by potential threats to its
energy supplies. It has virtually no oil or gas reserves of its
own, and relies for more than 70 percent of its oil supply on the
four Gulf states that Abe is visiting.
