US President George W. Bush retains "full confidence" in
embattled World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, who faces a crunch
meeting with restive bank directors, the White House said Monday.


"The president has full confidence in Paul Wolfowitz's ability to
continue to lead the World Bank," spokesman Tony Fratto said as
Wolfowitz battled charges of peddling personal influence for his
girlfriend.
