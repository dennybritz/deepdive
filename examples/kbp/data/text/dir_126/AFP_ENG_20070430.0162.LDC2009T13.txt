A group of 22 Egyptian Islamists who have been in prison for a
year urged the authorities to comply with a court decision to
release them, in a statement obtained by AFP on Monday.


"Al-Taefa al-Mansura (the Victorious Sect, in Arabic) affirms its
peaceful stance and rejection of violence and stresses that
accusations against its members are unsubstantiated and were
dismissed by the tribunal," the statement said.


"Since we have never taken up arms nor envisaged a resort to
violence, we appeal to the authorities' clemency and argue that
nothing justifies our continued detention," it added.


The statement was handed to journalists by the wife of Ahmed Ali
Gabr, one of the main leaders of the little-known Islamist
organisation.


Egypt announced the arrest of 22 members of Al-Taefa al-Mansura
in April 2006.


They were accused of planning to blow up gas pipelines in Cairo,
assassinate public figures and acquire a plot of land in Egypt to
conduct secret paramilitary training.


A civil court had ordered their release due to lack of evidence
in September 2006, but the security services have kept the group
behind bars.
