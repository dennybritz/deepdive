Officials in Pakistan announced Monday a further tightening of
export controls on nuclear material and missile technology.


A new unit in the foreign ministry, the Strategic Export Control
Division (SECDIV), will now be the only authority able to approve
the export of nuclear- related items and missile technology, the
ministry said.


It would also have authority over biological agents and toxins,
it said.


Representatives from other ministries, including finance,
commerce and the strategic planning division, will be part of the
export control authority, the foreign ministry's spokeswoman
Tasnim Aslam told reporters.


"The adoption of Export Control Act ... and the establishment of
SECDIV are a continuing manifestation of Pakistan's strong
commitment to non-proliferation and its determination to fulfill
its national and international export control commitments," Aslam
said.


The Act was passed in September 2004 to prevent the proliferation
of nuclear and biological weapons.


Pakistan was rocked by an arms proliferation scandal that same
year when the architect of the country's atomic weapons
programme, Abdul Qadeer Khan, publicly confessed to leaking
nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea.


Khan was given a conditional pardon by Pakistan's President
Pervez Musharraf, who insisted the government was not involved.
