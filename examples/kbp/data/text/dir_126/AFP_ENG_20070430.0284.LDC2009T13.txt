Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert vowed to correct mistakes
committed during last year's war in Lebanon after receiving the
interim report on the failures of the conflict on Monday.


"We shall examine the report and immediately try to learn the
lessons we must learn and correct all the mistakes," Olmert told
members of a government commission investigating the 34-day
conflict.


"We must ensure that in any future scenario in the state of
Israel, the failures that you point out will be corrected,"
Olmert said.


Retired judge Eliahu Winograd was to publicly present the interim
findings at a press conference in Jerusalem at 1400 GMT.


According to media leaks, the report is due to harshly criticise
the way Olmert, his Defence Minister Amir Peretz and former army
chief of staff Dan Halutz handled the 34-day war, but stop short
of calling for resignations, according to media leaks.
