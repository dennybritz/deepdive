India's ruling Congress party was criticised by lawmakers Monday
over rising inflation and fears the country's booming economy is
overheating.


"People in villages do not understand what is a nine percent
economic growth rate," said Vijay Krishna, the leader of the
regional RJD party, which props up Congress in parliament's lower
house.


"People only talk about how prices of essential commodities like
tomato, potato and others are going up," he said during a debate
in parliament.


Inflation is hovering at 6.09 percent in India, compared with
3.70 percent a year earlier and well above the central bank's 5.0
percent target.


Congress came to power in 2004 on a "pro-poor" mandate, but
analysts say rising inflation hurts India's poor the most.


The central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has warned of
economic overheating and has raised interest rates to try to curb
inflation.


The recent rout of the Congress party in two state assembly
elections and in municipal polls in New Delhi has been partly
attributed by analysts to rising inflation.
