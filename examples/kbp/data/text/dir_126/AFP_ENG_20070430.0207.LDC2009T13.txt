Environmental group Greenpeace said Monday that an illegal
genetically modified maize had been found in a US shipment to
Europe, the fourth such case in two years.


Greenpeace said it had analysed cargo that arrived in the port at
Rotterdam, the Netherlands on April 10 and found that it
contained 2.4 percent of the GMO Herculex, a maize manufactured
by the firm Pioneer and not yet legal in the EU.


It said in a statement that the ship carrying the maize had
offloaded some cargo in Ireland but the group could not determine
whether the GMO had landed there.


The European Commission said it had not been told about the find,
but that if it were the case it would be "up to the Dutch
authorities to send the maize back to the United States."


Since new authorisation rules were introduced in 2004, about 10
GM strains have been cleared for the EU market, mainly for maize
destined for human or animal consumption.


The EU has seen three "major incidences" of unauthorised GM
products -- all originating from the United States -- reaching
the EU market since the new rules went into force.


Those episodes concerned the discovery of shipments of long-grain
GM rice, maize gluten last year, and Hawaiian papaya in 2004 and
2005.


Herculex has received a "positive scientific evaluation" from EU
food safety experts and the bloc is expected to decide on June 8
whether it should be allowed in.
