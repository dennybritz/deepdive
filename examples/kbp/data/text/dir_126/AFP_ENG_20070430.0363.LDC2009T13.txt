British Minister for Europe Geoff Hoon voiced condolences on
Monday over the death of Croatia's former premier Ivica Racan,
who set the Balkan country on the path to European Union
membership.


Racan "played a very important role, both during his time as
prime minister  and as leader of the Social Democratic Party, in
moving his country and the region towards a stable and prosperous
future," Hoon said in a letter sent to acting SDP head Zeljka
Antunovic.


"He will be much missed," he added.


Racan, 63, served as prime minister between 2000 and late 2003.
He died in a Zagreb hospital on Sunday after a three-month long
battle with kidney cancer.


His government is credited with improving Croatia's image in the
aftermath of its 1991-1995 war of independence from the former
Yugoslavia, and ending its isolation after years of autocratic
rule by nationalist president Franjo Tudjman, who died in 1999.


Racan made Zagreb's first steps toward membership of the EU,
which the current conservative government continued with the
opening of negotiations in 2005.


The Social Democrats have yet to elect Racan's successor ahead of
general polls later this year.


He will be buried at a private funeral.
