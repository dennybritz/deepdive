A French TV worker has been sacked for letting a "joke" about
right-wing presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy slip into the
English-language subtitles of a news report, his employer said
Monday.


In the US version of a news bulletin by the public broadcaster
France 2 last week, a Sarkozy appeal to French voters to join his
campaign was translated as a call for them to "to rally my
inflated ego".


The erroneous subtitles were broadcast to cable television
viewers in the United States, including in New York, where the
slip was reported on several French expatriate websites.


France 2 director general Philippe Baudillon said the subtitler
responsible had been dismissed, calling the incident
"unacceptable".


He said the US freelancers who translate the news reports
"sometimes joke among themselves by playing around with the
subtitles" and that short-staffing had allowed one such "joke" to
make it on air unnoticed.
