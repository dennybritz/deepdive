Estonian authorities have uncovered the coffins of 12 Soviet
soldiers buried under a war memorial which was controversially
moved last week and opened six to find remains inside, a forensic
scientist said Monday.


Ullar Labo, director of the Forensic Medical Bureau, told a press
briefing at the defence ministry that the coffins, buried towards
the end of World War II, were in two rows of six.


The first row had been opened and work was continuing to access
the second row, he said.


One Russian man was killed and more than 150 people injured,
including 29 police, in two nights of rioting in Tallinn last
Thursday and Friday after the monument was moved.
