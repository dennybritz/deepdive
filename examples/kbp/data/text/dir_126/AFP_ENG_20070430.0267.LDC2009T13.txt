US President George W. Bush retains "full confidence" in
embattled World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, who faces a crunch
meeting with restive bank directors, the White House said Monday.


"The president has full confidence in Paul Wolfowitz's ability to
continue to lead the World Bank," spokesman Tony Fratto said as
Wolfowitz battled charges of peddling personal influence for his
girlfriend.


At the meeting with a World Bank investigatory committee, the
former Pentagon number two will plead his case over revelations
that he ordered a huge pay package for his girlfriend, Shaha
Riza.


The committee, drawn from the full board of 24 national
representatives, is examining not just the Riza affair but his
hiring of former White House aides to influential, and highly
paid, jobs in his inner circle.


A report in The Washington Post Saturday said the bank panel had
already concluded that Wolfowitz breached ethics in engineering
Riza's raise, but remained locked in debate over whether to call
explicitly for his resignation.


"As members of the board we can't comment on those proceedings,
but we certainly continue to support Paul and expect the review
process to be fair and respectful," said Fratto.
