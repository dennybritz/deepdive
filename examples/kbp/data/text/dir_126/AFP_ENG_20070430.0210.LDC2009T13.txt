Estonian authorities have uncovered the coffins of 12 Soviet
soldiers buried under a war memorial which was controversially
moved last week, a forensic scientist said Monday.


Ullar Labo, director of the Forensic Medical Bureau, told a press
briefing at the defence ministry that the coffins, buried towards
the end of World War II, were in two rows of six.


The first row had been opened and work was continuing to access
the second row, he said.


One Russian man was killed and more than 150 people injured,
including 29 police, in two nights of rioting in Tallinn last
Thursday and Friday after the monument was moved.


The excavation work was carried out after the removal of the
Bronze Soldier statue.


The memorial to Soviet Red Army soldiers who died in the war was
to be re- erected in a military cemetery Monday afternoon, the
Estonian defence ministry said.


The removal of the statue has caused tensions between Estonia and
Russia. Estonians consider the statue to be a symbol of 50 years
of Soviet occupation up to 1991. Russians say it is a tribute to
those who fought the Nazis in World War II.


The statue will be inaugurated in its new site on May 8, the
anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.
