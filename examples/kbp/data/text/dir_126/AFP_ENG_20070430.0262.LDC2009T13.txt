Students of a school in a wealthy neighbourhood of the French
city of Lyon paid to watch a pre-planned fight between two of
their classmates that left one of them with a broken jaw, police
and education officials said Monday.


One of the 40 students watching the brawl filmed the event that
took place on April 19 following a verbal dispute between the two
15-year-old combattants, said the principal of the Vendome
college.


Some of the students paid to attend the fight, he said.


The boy with the broken jaw was still in hospital Monday. He has
pressed charges. His adversary has been expelled from the school
and is to face a disciplinary hearing into the incident.


The student who filmed the scene has been temporarily suspended
while authorities learn whether he circulated the film to others.
He risks being charged for his complicity in the incident.
