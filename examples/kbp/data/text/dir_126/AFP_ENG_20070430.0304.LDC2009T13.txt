German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse said Monday it
planned to bid 2.8 billion dollars (2.1 billion euros) for the
New York-based International Securities Exchange, the second-
biggest US options market.


The German group, which has failed with previous attempts to buy
the London Stock Exchange and pan-European operator Euronext,
said it would bid 67.50 dollars per share in cash via its
subsidiary Eurex, a joint venture with Swiss partner SWX.


"The supervisory board of Deutsche Boerse, the supervisory board
of SWX and the ISE board of directors shall decide on the
transaction today (Monday)," the Deutsche Boerse said in a
statement.


The proposed deal comes at a time of rapid consolidation of world
financial markets following the merger of the New York Stock
Exchange and Euronext earlier this year.


ISE is the second-biggest market for options trading in the
United States with 28 percent of the market, behind the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE) which has 37 percent.


Options are financial instruments that offer a buyer or seller
the right to buy or sell an asset at an agreed-upon price in the
future.


Traders use options to speculate, which is a risky practice,
while companies or investors use options to "hedge" or reduce the
risk of price fluctuations.


Trade in Deutsche Boerse shares was suspended awaiting
announcement of the outcome of the deal.
