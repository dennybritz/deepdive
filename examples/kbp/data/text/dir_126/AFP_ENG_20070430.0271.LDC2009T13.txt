A British judge on Monday handed down life sentences to a group
of five militants found guilty of plotting a series of deadly
bomb attacks in Britain.


Judge Sir Michael Astill told the five at London's Central
Criminal Court that they would have to serve between 35 and 40
years minimum in jail before being considered for parole.


"You have betrayed this country that has given you every
opportunity," said judge Sir Michael Astill.


"All of you may never be released. It is not a foregone
conclusion."


The five were among seven men who have spent just over a year on
trial charged in connection with what police said was the largest
counter-terrorism operation at the time.


It involved an international conspiracy to blow up a central
nightclub, shopping centre, down a plane and target Britain's gas
and electricity network that police said would have caused "mass
murder" had it come to fruition.


The men were convicted on Monday morning after the jury had
deliberated for 27 days. Two others were cleared.
