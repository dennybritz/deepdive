Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko will meet Pope Benedict XVI
next week while on a visit to Rome, the Vatican announced Monday.


The audience with the pontiff on May 7 will be on the sidelines
of Yushchenko's official visit to Italy, which will take place
May 6-8, according to the Ukrainian president's office.


The pro-Western president has already invited the pope to visit
Ukraine through its new envoy to the Vatican, who presented his
credentials late last month.


Benedict's predecessor John Paul II visited Ukraine in 2001.


Some 7.6 percent of Ukraine's population belong to the Uniate
Church, part of the Roman Catholic Church's eastern rite.


They back Yushchenko in his long-running power struggle with pro-
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich.
