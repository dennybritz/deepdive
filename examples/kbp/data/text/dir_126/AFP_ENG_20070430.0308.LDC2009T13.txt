A former lawmaker in Bangladesh was jailed for three years on
Monday as part of a crackdown on corruption by the country's
government, police said.


Shamim Osman of the Awami League party was the first of scores of
prominent figures to be sentenced after the military-backed
emergency government pledged to clean up politics to pave the way
for free elections.


Osman was found guilty of failing to submit his financial details
to the country's Anti-Corruption Commission, police official
Abdus Salam said.


"The district court in Narayanganj ... sentenced Shamim Osman to
three years of rigorous imprisonment. He was the first among the
top corruption suspects to be sentenced by the court," he said.


Osman was named in the anti-graft body's first list of top 50
corruption suspects after the military-backed government took
power following the imposition of a state of emergency in
January.


Most of those listed, including the son of former prime minister
Khaleda Zia and more than a dozen ex-ministers, have been
detained since the launch of the anti- graft drive in February.


The new government vowed to clean up politics and carry out
sweeping reforms before announcing a new date for elections.
Early this month the head of the government pledged that the
polls would be held before the end of 2008.
