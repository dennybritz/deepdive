Sri Lankan police stepped up security in the capital Monday as
political parties prepared to stage May Day rallies a day ahead
of the rest of the world, officials said.


The May Day rallies were advanced to April 30 because the
international labour day coincided with the most important
Buddhist festival known as Wesak, celebrated on the fifth full
moon of the year, a government official said.


This year, May 1 will be celebrated across most of the Buddhist
world as the anniversary of the birth, enlightenment and the
passing away of the Buddha.


Police said the advanced May Day rallies in Colombo were so far
low key, but the Marxist JVP, or the People Liberation Front, was
expected to turn out in large numbers later Monday.


"We have brought policemen from outside Colombo to reinforce the
security arrangements in the city," a senior officer said.


Sri Lanka has also ordered all liquor stores to close from Sunday
for five days as a sign of respect for Buddhists, who form a
majority in the nation of 19.5 million people.


Police said security forces had also been asked to assist them in
maintaining law and order in a country that is ruled under a
state of emergency.


The May Day rallies follow a Tamil Tiger air attack against two
oil storage facilities in Colombo on Sunday as part of a bitter
ethnic conflict that has claimed more than 60,000 lives in the
past 35 years.


Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels launched a suicide bomb attack in
1993 during a ruling party May Day rally and assassinated then
president Ranasinghe Premadasa.
