Right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy is a dangerous demagogue
whose election to the presidency would create "the risk of a
France at war with itself", more than 100 leading left-wing
figures in the arts and sciences said Monday in an open letter in
the newspaper Liberation.


Calling on readers to vote for Socialist Segolene Royal in
Sunday's election run-off, the group said that "Nicolas Sarkozy
embodies a hard radicalised right, under the influence of the
far-right with all its fears and hates."


"Entrusting the presidency to a demagogue like this means a real
danger of seeing power confiscated by a caste, a gang or a
clan....


"To vote against Nicolas Sarkozy is to avoid the danger of a
France at war with itself, in conflict and in crisis, divided and
torn apart," they said.


Signatories included stage and screen artists Jeanne Moreau,
Philippe Torreton and Sylvie Testud, film directors Francois Ozon
and Constantin Costa-Gavras, singer Georges Moustaki, along with
writers, historians and scientists.
