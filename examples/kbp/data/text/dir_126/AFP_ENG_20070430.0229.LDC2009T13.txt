Austria's Erste Bank on Monday reported record net earnings in
the first quarter compared with the same period last year but its
share price fell sharply on weaker-than-expected growth in net
interest income.


The bank said net earnings came to a record 302.1 million euros
(410 million dollars) in the first quarter compared with the same
period last year, which it it attributed to its operations in
central Europe.


The performance eclipsed market expectations of a 21.4 percent
gain in net profit.


But Erste Bank shares were down 3.27 percent at 59.49 euros in
mid-day trade.


Analysts said investors were disappointed with the increase in
net interest income on loans, which came to 24.8 percent rather
than the expected 32.4 percent.


The first-quarter results nonetheless reflected the positive
impact of its acquisition of a 61.8 percent stake in Banca
Comerciala Romana of Romania in December 2005.


Erste now has operations in seven countries in central and
eastern Europe and the Balkans. Last December it acquired the
Ukrainian bank Prestige for 79.4 million euros.


The managing director of Erste, Andreas Treichl said the bank now
wanted to boost net earnings by 25 percent this year and by at
least 20 percent in 2008 and 2009.
