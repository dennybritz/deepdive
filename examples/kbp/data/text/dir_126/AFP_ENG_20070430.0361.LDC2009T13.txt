At least 23 mourners were killed and 17 wounded when a suicide
bomber blew himself up at a Shiite family wake on Monday
northeast of the Iraqi capital, police and security sources said.


"A man wearing a suicide belt walked into the Shiite wake and
just blew himself up," said Captain Ahmed Abdallah of the police
in Khalis, 80 kilometres (50 miles) northeast of Baghdad in
Diyala province.


He told AFP that 23 people were killed and 17 wounded, revising
an earlier casualty toll.


A defense ministry official in Baghdad confirmed the report.


Diyala province has been riven by savage Sunni-Shiite sectarian
fighting, making it the most dangerous province in the country
after the capital Baghdad.


Long neglected by US forces since the 2003 invasion, the growing
violence and instability has finally resulted in more forces
being sent to the restive province.
