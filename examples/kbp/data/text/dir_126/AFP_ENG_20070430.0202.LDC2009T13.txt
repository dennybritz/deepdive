The pro-Russian majority in Ukraine's parliament voted Monday in
favour of snap parliamentary and presidential elections in the
latest twist to a long-running power struggle with pro-Western
President Viktor Yushchenko.


Parliament deputies -- a majority of whom are loyal to Moscow-
backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych -- voted in the non-
binding resolution for a joint election to take place by December
9 this year.


Yushchenko has repeatedly refused to hold early presidential
elections, while his decree disbanding parliament and ordering
early legislative elections has been rejected by Yanukovych.


The two camps are now locked in a bitter power struggle that has
seen almost daily demonstrations by thousands of their
supporters.
