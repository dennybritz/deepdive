Gavin Henson and former captain Colin Charvis have been given a
chance to stake a claim for World Cup selection after being named
in the 28-strong Wales squad's two-Test tour to Australia this
summer.


Henson, 25, has not played since January because of a knee injury
but might get a run out for his club Ospreys against Border
Reivers in the final match weekend of the Celtic League before
departing down under.


Backrower Charvis has been in cracking form for Newport-Gwent
Dragons but has not played a Test for his country since the 18-18
draw with Italy in March 2006.


Coach Gareth Jenkins has chosen former skipper Gareth Thomas as
tour captain despite objections from his club Toulouse.


A total of 18 frontline Wales players, including Lions Shane
Williams, Tom Shanklin, Stephen Jones, Dwayne Peel and Martyn
Williams, will remain at home and take part in a summer training
camp.


For the Australia tour, there are also recalls for Scarlets pair
Dafydd James and Iestyn Thomas, plus Dragons No 8 Michael Owen,
who was dropped from Wales' Six Nations squad.


Also included among the back-row options is Cardiff Blues open-
side Robin Sowden-Taylor, who has made a successful return from
the broken and dislocated ankle he suffered in September.


Wales play Australia in the first Test in Sydney on May 26, with
the return a week later in Brisbane.
