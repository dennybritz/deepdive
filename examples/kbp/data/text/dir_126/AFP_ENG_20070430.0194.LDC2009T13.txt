India's biggest consumer goods company Hindustan Lever said
Monday that first quarter net profit dropped 11 percent due to
expenses related to the purchase of a new unit.


The company, a unit of Anglo-Dutch Unilever, posted a net profit
of 3.93 billion rupees (96 million dollars) for the quarter ended
March 31, from 4.43 billion rupees a year ago.


However total income rose 13.6 percent to 32.8 billion rupees in
the first quarter, from 28.7 billion rupees a year earlier.


Hindustan Lever said in a notice to the Mumbai stock exchange
that the results for the quarter were not strictly comparable
with the year earlier period because of the purchase of Modern
Foods (India).


The company's shares fell 10.10 rupees or 4.82 percent to 199.40,
while the benchmark Mumbai stock exchange Sensex index closed
down 36.21 points or 0.26 percent to 13,872.37.
