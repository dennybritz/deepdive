Thailand's government will hire a US public relations firm to
help improve the country's image after last year's military coup,
Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said Monday.


"The foreign ministry proposed hiring a US public relations firm
for three months," he told reporters.


"The company will explain (Thailand's political situation) to
people in the US and other countries," he said, adding the
government had agreed to pay the company 200,000 dollars a month.


The decision came three months after ousted prime minister
Thaksin Shinawatra hired two Washington lobbyists, purportedly to
study the international legal and political issues surrounding
his ouster by the military in September.


He has denied having any further political ambitions, but the
junta has been infuriated by his travel to capitals across Europe
and Asia since he was deposed.


Thaksin has stayed in exile since the coup and is currently in
Beijing, according to his lawyer.
