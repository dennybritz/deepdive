A DR Congo military court cleared on Monday an opposition leader
and former presidential candidate and nine others of charges of
leading an attempted insurrection last year.


The case against Marie-Therese N'Landu Nene, her driver, her
press attache and the other co-accused was not established, the
head of the court, Major Mboloko Ewawa, declared at the end of
the four-month trial.


N'Landu Nene, a candidate in last year's elections and a leader
of the small opposition Congo Pax party, had been charged after a
November 2006 demonstration she attended ended with a fire in
Kinshasa's Supreme Court building.


The state sought a 20-year prison term for her and seven others
and a year's sentence for her driver.


Monday's ruling was hailed by the defence who had earlier
repeatedly complained that N'landu Nene was facing a "political
trial."


Joseph Mukendi, one of her lawyers, said: "This is proof that
military justice can also be fair."


N'Landu Nene also called upon President Joseph Kabila to release
several "innocent" people languishing in jail following clashes
between the guards of his arch-foe Jean-Pierre Bemba and
government soldiers.
