Two former Scottish world champions suffered varying fortunes on
Monday at the world snooker championships.


Seven-time champion Steven Hendry's dream of pulling off his
greatest ever world title victory came crashing to the floor as
he was outclassed 13-6 by Englishman Ali Carter.


However Hendry's compatriot John Higgins had no such problems
needing just 10 minutes to round off a 13-4 romp over Irishman
Fergal O'Brien as he joined Carter in the last eight.


Hendry - who came into the championships using a new cue and
having still to win a ranking tournament since the 2005 Malta
Open - required a miracle to extricate himself from a 12-4
deficit overnight and showed some fight by taking the first two
frames of the session.


However Carter ended the 38-year-old's misery by taking the third
frame.


"I played well and I was really pleased with my form," Carter
told BBC Sport.


"People might talk about Stephen's cue but I put him under
pressure."


Higgins didn't waste any time to send O'Brien packing.


Higgins resumed with a commanding 12-4 lead after an outstanding
display in the second session.


O'Brien battled gamely to close his arrears, but a misjudged
safety shot let the in-form Scot back to the table.


And Higgins made no mistake as he set up a meeting with either
two-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan or in-form Australia Neil
Robertson, who had fought back from a 6-2 deficit in the first
session to send the tie into the final session later on Monday
level at 8-8.
