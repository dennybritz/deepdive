Two men in a stolen car forced a security checkpoint but finished
up in the water at the port of Valencia, which is hosting
qualifying races for the America's Cup sailing competition,
police said Monday.


The pair, a Romanian and a Spaniard, were fished out of the canal
and arrested after the incident, which took place late Saturday
as a crowd was attending a concert nearby.


The scare happened despite a major security operation surrounding
the international sailing event for the Luis-Vuitton Cup.


It involves 2,000 police officers and security agents, 25 boats,
five surveillance helicopters, as well as security cameras and
metal detectors.


The Louis Vuitton winner earns the right to take on Swiss
defender Alinghi in the best of nine match series for the 32nd
America's Cup starting on June 23.
