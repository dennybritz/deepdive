Russian lawmakers visiting Estonia on Monday to discuss the
controversial relocation of a Soviet-era war monument said the
Baltic state's government should resign over the crisis, Interfax
reported.


"Our opinion is that the government should resign," Russian State
Duma member Nikolai Kovalev was quoted as saying.


"It is obvious that the government provoked this crisis and could
not cope with the disorder in which one person died."


Kovalev was with a delegation flying to Tallinn for talks
following the removal of the Soviet war memorial from a central
square and deadly riots.


Estonians see the statue as a reminder of 50 years of Soviet
occupation following World War II and are moving the Bronze
Soldier to the less central military cemetery in the capital.


Russia says the statue should stay where it is and blames Estonia
for the street violence.


"What's happening in Estonia is without precedent in world
history. You can't call it anything other than a provocation
against Russia," Kovalev said on Russian state television.


"It's a premeditated act that forces us to take a very tough
position."


Kovalev praised the protestors on Tallinn's streets and said he
aimed to free all demonstrators from detention. Estonia's
authorities accuse the protestors of looting and random violence.
