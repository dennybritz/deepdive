British defence minister Des Browne met his Iraqi counterpart in
Baghdad on Monday to discuss current efforts to improve security
in the volatile country.


Browne and Abdul Qader Jassim Mohammed talked about the ongoing
security crackdown in Baghdad and recent progress made in the war
against Al-Qaeda in the western province of Anbar, the Iraqi
Defence Ministry said.


The province, considered the heartland of the country's Sunni
insurgency, has grown quieter in recent months following the
decision of some of the region's more powerful clans to ally with
US-led forces against Al-Qaeda.


Browne "expressed his satisfaction regarding the decision of the
tribes in Anbar to confront the terror in the city," according to
the statement.


He also praised the 7,100 British troops operating in the south
of the country, and the Iraqi forces who have recently taken over
responsibility for two bases in the port city of Basra once
controlled by Britain.
