France's World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez has quit his
club Nantes for safety reasons following a violent post-match
run-in with a group of disgruntled supporters.


"I'm not going to play for Nantes again. I don't feel ready to
live like that," said the 87-time capped keeper who arrived at
Nantes during the winter transfer window.


"I don't feel safe there and I'd just prefer to leave."


Basement side Nantes succumbed to a 2-0 home defeat to Rennes on
Saturday, a and after just five minutes into the match, Barthez
became the target of insults from certain sections of the Nantes
support.


Five supporters accosted him in the stadium car park after the
game, insulting him and then attacking his car as he tried to
drive away from the scene.


Barthez was forced to fight back as one of his assailants tried
to pull him from the driver's seat.


"It's got nothing to do with the football or the results,"
Barthez told France Info radio. "What happened goes beyond the
sporting realm... and without that I would have stayed with
Nantes until the end."


He added: "I accepted being whistled throughout a match because
that's part of the game."


Barthez, 35, has been unsettled since joining Nantes in January
and been accused on several occasions of feigning injury to avoid
training.


In his 14 matches with the club, the former Marseille and
Manchester United keeper has conceded 23 goals.
