US stocks opened mixed Monday as the market paused following a
record-setting series of sessions and digested the latest
economic report, which appeared to ease inflation fears.


In opening trades, the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted down
3.33 points (0.03 percent) to 13,117.61 after the blue-chip index
set three consecutive record highs last week.


The Nasdaq composite eased 1.65 points (0.06 percent) to 2,555.56
while the broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index edged up
1.22 points (0.08 percent) to 1,495.29.


The market, which has been on a tear following better-than-
expected corporate earnings, digested news that US consumer
spending rose 0.3 percent in March and personal incomes increased
0.7 percent.


Although the spending figure was below expectations, traders
focused on the inflation component of the report showing core
prices up just 0.1 percent.


"This good inflation news will give stocks a boost today," said
Dick Green at Briefing.com, who added that the market appears
somewhat overextended.


"The market momentum remains good, but the indices are clearly
running ahead of the fundamentals. It isn't a trend to fight, but
it is important to recognize that the expansion ... that is
occurring is based on shaky fundamental foundations."
