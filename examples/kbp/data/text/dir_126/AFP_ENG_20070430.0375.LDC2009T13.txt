Italian cycling star Ivan Basso has parted company with his team,
Discovery Channel, the American cycling team announced Monday.


Basso, one of dozens of riders implicated in the Operation Puerto
doping affair, was suspended by the team last week after the
Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) called him to a hearing this
week to answer doping charges.


Discovery said then they stood by the 29-year-old Tour of Italy
champion, who was set to lead their bid to win the Tour de France
yellow jersey in July.


However on Monday the American outfit announced that Basso had
asked to be released from his contract.


A statement quoted Basso as saying: "This was a very difficult
decision, for me and my family, but I think it is the right thing
to do."


"This decision is my way of showing them that same respect."


Discovery will end their sponsorship of the team, which is not
connected to the ongoing investigation, at the end of the current
season.


Basso added: "The Team is trying to find a new sponsor and win
bike races, and my situation is a distraction to both of those
goals.


"It is important that everyone knows this was 100 percent my
decision. Nobody asked me to leave. I am grateful to all of the
staff and riders and wish them the best of luck."
