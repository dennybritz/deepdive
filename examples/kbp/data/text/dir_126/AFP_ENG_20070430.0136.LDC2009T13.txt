Most Israeli Arabs support a constitution that would qualify
Israel as a "Jewish and democratic" state that guarantees them
equal rights with the Jewish majority, according to poll results
published on Monday.


Seventy-five percent of Israeli Arabs would approve such a
constitution, compared with 23 percent who would not, said the
survey published in the liberal Haaretz daily.


Israel currently has Basic Law, but no constitution.


The poll findings mark a decrease of 14 percentage points to a
similar survey carried out in 2004, when 89 percent of Israeli
Arabs polled said they would back such a constitution.


The latest poll questioned 507 people, had a margin of error of
four percentage points and was commissioned by an Israeli
association called "Constitution by Choice."


Descendants of some 160,000 Arabs who remained in Israel
following the creation of the Jewish state in 1948, Israeli Arabs
vote and have 10 representatives in the 120-seat parliament.


Their standard of living is 10 times higher than that of
Palestinians in the occupied territories, but they see themselves
as being treated as second-class citizens by Israel.


In February 2006, the Supreme Court recognised that Israeli Arabs
faced discrimination. The unanimous ruling said the state
"exercises political discrimination" against Arabs by favouring
Jewish localities, especially in education.
