US consumer spending grew at a slower pace in March while
personal income gains remained robust, the government said
Monday.


The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose just 0.3
percent last month, disappointing Wall Street analysts who had
expected spending to rise at least 0.5 percent last month.


Spending, a key economic gauge which makes up the lion's share of
overall US economic activity, slowed from a 0.7 percent clip in
the prior month.


Personal income remained solid, however, rising 0.7 percent for
the second straight month, a couple of notches better than most
economists had predicted.


The slowdown in consumer spending growth from April comes after
US economic growth slowed considerably during the first quarter,
mainly as a housing market slump acted as a drag on growth.


The report also showed inflation, as measured by the personal
consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.4 percent in March
for the second straight month, bringing the year-over-year
increase to 2.4 percent.


Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices
and is considered by the Federal Reserve to be a better barometer
of prices, rose 0.1 percent in the month, in line with most
forecasts.


On a year-on-year basis, core inflation rose 2.1 percent.
