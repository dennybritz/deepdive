Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez at the head of political and
business delegation held talks on Monday with Emirati President
Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, WAM state news agency
reported.


They discussed ways to enhance cooperation between the two
countries and progress in free trade talks between the oil-rich
Gulf Cooperation Council and Mercosur, the South American common
market, it said.


Vazquez arrived late Sunday in the capital of the United Arab
Emirates, his first stop in a two-nation tour which will take him
on to Dubai on Tuesday and Doha on Wednesday.


He is accompanied by a delegation that includes business leaders
and five cabinet members, including the foreign, economy and
tourism ministers, sources from his office said.


"The trip aims to strengthen political relations, expand trade
and gain investments for infrastructure for the country's main
tourist destinations," a presidential source said ahead of the
visit.
