The Israeli government commission probing last year's Lebanon war
on Monday began presenting findings from its first partial
report, due to harshly criticise Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.


Retired judge Eliahu Winograd began reading the interim findings
at a press conference in Jerusalem, an hour after handing a copy
to Olmert.


The report is due to harshly criticise the way Olmert, his
Defence Minister Amir Peretz and former army chief of staff Dan
Halutz handled the 34-day war, but stop short of calling for
resignations, according to media leaks.
