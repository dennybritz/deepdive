Fifty people were killed during Nigeria's flawed governorship
elections earlier this month, the country's electoral agency said
Monday.


Independent National Electoral Commission spokesman Philip Umeadi
told reporters that of these, 39 were police officers and 11 were
civilians.


A breakdown of the figures showed that 16 people died in the
northern city of Kano, nine in Nasarawa, eight in Adamawa, seven
in Rivers, five in Edo, two in Kogi, while Delta, Ondo and
Plateau recorded one death each.


Umeadi said 1,093 suspects were arrested in connection with the
poll-related violence, adding that they would soon be prosecuted.


He said casualty figures for the April 21 presidential poll were
still being collated.


European Union election monitors last week estimated that some
200 people, including police, were killed during the two stages
of voting in West Africa's most populous country.


The ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) won a landslide in the
elections which were criticised by the United States and the
European Union as the worst in Nigeria's recent history.


Opposition parties and civil society groups have called for the
cancellation of the vote and threatened to refuse to recognise a
government formed from it. They have called for peaceful protests
starting Tuesday.


Elections in some districts were rerun on Saturday but were
marred by voter apathy.
