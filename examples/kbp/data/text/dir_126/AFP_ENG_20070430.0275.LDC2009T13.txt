An organisation representing African working women on Monday
denounced a decision to overturn a law that would have guaranteed
a minimum number of female deputies in parliament.


RAFET, the African Network of Working Women, said Friday's
decision by the constitutional council to overturn the law was
disappointing, but urged President Abdoulaye Wade to persevere
with such legislation.


The council ruled that a law passed by parliament late March
violated the constitution, thus vindicating the 12 opposition
deputies, including two women, who had brought the case before
them.


The constitution only granted rights to citizens and not to
categories of citizens, said the ruling.


The law, which its backers had described as "salutary and
revolutionary", would have meant that at least 30 women would
have been among the 150 deputies of the parliamentary assembly:
20 percent of the total.


"Now the constitutional obstacle must be lifted," RAFET president
Amsatou Sow Sidibe, a law professor at a leading Dakar
university, told AFP.


"That is possible simply by the parliamentary route. It is a
question of human rights and democracy," she said.


Senegal in any case currently has nearly 19.2 percent female
representation in parliament, which puts it 13th on the list of
African countries, and 56th worldwide -- ahead of Italy and
France.
