Syrian Vice President Faruq al-Shara on Monday blamed the
"violent policies" of the United States and Israel for the plight
of millions of Iraqi and Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.


"The policies of violence and force pursued by Washington and Tel
Aviv threaten international security and stability, and pose a
major obstacle to true peace between Arabs and Israel," he
charged in a speech in Damascus.


"The United States and Israel are the main parties responsible
for the influx of millions of Palestinian and Iraqi refugees to
neighbouring Arab countries," Shara said.


"These two countries should assume the security, economic and
moral consequences," he told a conference on the Arab and Islamic
press which the state media said attracted more than 300
participants.


The EU's development and humanitarian aid commissioner, Louis
Michel, on a visit to Damascus on Sunday, numbered Iraqi refugees
in Syria at between 1.2 million and 1.5 million.


Jordan also hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the
carnage in neighbouring Iraq.
