Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert along with Defence Minister
Amir Peretz and former army chief Dan Halutz are to blame for
failures of the Lebanon war, said a government inquiry released
on Monday.


"The responsibility is on the prime minister, the defence
minister and chief of staff," retired judge Eliahu Winograd said
in presenting the interim findings into the handling of the
34-day war.


"Severe mistakes" were made, he said.
