Around 40 Cairo-based journalists gathered Monday in the Egyptian
capital to express solidarity with BBC journalist Alan Johnston,
exactly seven weeks after his kidnapping in the Gaza Strip.


The group of foreign and Egyptian reporters gathered on the steps
of the journalists syndicate in Cairo, holding posters demanding
the 44-year-old Johnston's release.


"Those who kidnapped Alan Johnston cannot claim to be resistants
fighting against Israeli occupation," Egyptian journalist Mahmud
Bakri said during the vigil.


Johnston is the only foreign journalist to have been based in the
troubled Gaza Strip on a permanent basis over the past three
years.


He was snatched at gunpoint while driving home from work in Gaza
City on March 12 and there is still no clear indication of his
fate.


Palestinian deputy prime minister Azzam al-Ahmed said last week
his office had information indicating that Johnston was in good
health.


On April 15, a little-known Islamist group claimed to have killed
him, but Palestinian authorities have said there was no proof of
the claim by the Kataeb al-Jihad al-Tawheed (The Brigades of Holy
War and Unity).
