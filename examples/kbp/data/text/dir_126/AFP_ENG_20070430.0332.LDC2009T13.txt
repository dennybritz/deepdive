At least 11 mourners were killed and 21 wounded when a suicide
bomber blew himself up at a Shiite family wake on Monday
northeast of the Iraqi capital, police and security sources said.


"A man wearing a suicide belt walked into the Shiite wake and
just blew himself up," said Captain Ahmed Abdallah of the police
in Khalis, 80 kilometres (50 miles) northeast of Baghdad in
Diyala province.


A defense ministry official in Baghdad confirmed the report.


Diyala province has been riven by savage Sunni-Shiite sectarian
fighting, making it the most dangerous province in the country
after the capital Baghdad.
