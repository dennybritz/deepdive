The Gulf state of Kuwait has made a significant oil and gas
discovery in a new oilfield in the north of the country, Oil
Minister Sheikh Ali Jarrah al-Sabah announced Monday.


"Initial tests indicate the presence of large quantities of light
and high quality oil and huge quantities of associated gas," the
minister told the official KUNA news agency.


The minister gave no estimates for the size of the find and no
indication of when production might begin.


The find was made in the Dhabi area, south of the Rawdatin
oilfield close to the Iraqi border. It is the sixth oilfield to
be discovered in the area, the minister said.


Sheikh Ali said the new discovery would provide a major boost for
Kuwait's oil reserves, which are already officially placed at 99
billion barrels.


But the industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly
questioned the official figures in January last year, saying that
reserves stood at just 48 billion barrels, based on internal
Kuwaiti records it had seen.


The newsletter also reported that Kuwait's fully proven reserves
amounted to just 24.2 billion barrels.


Last year, Kuwait announced its first major free gas discovery,
also in the north of the country, and estimated the reserves at
one trillion cubic metres (35 trillion cubic feet). It also
discovered large quantities of light oil.


Kuwait has long been a major crude producer with some 10 percent
of the world's reserves and output of around 2.4 million barrels
per day.
